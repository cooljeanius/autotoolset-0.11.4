<h3 class="section">C.2 Why you should use the GPL</h3>

<p>The GPL is not the only way to implement copyleft. However, as a practical
matter, it is convenient to standardize on using the GPL to copyleft
software because that allows to copy source code from copylefted programs
and use it on other copylefted programs without worrying about license
compatibility.

   <p>If you want your program to be free, then GPL grants all the permissions
that are necessary to make it free. Some people do not like the GPL because
they feel it gives too many permissions. In that case, these people do
not really want their program to be free. When they choose to use a more
restrictive license, as a result, they are effectively choosing not to be part
of the free software community.

   <p>One very common restriction, that often comes up, is to allow free use only
for &ldquo;non-commercial&rdquo; purposes. The idea behind such a restriction
is to prevent anyone from making any money without giving you a cut of their
profit. Copyleft actually also serves this goal, but from a different angle. 
The angle is that making money is only one of the many benefits that one
can derive from using a computer program, and it should not be discriminated
against all the other benefits. Copyleft however does prevent others from
making money by modifying your program and distributing it as proprietary
software with restrictive licensing. If person wants to distribute the program,
person also has to distribute the source code, in which case you benefit
by having access to per <em>modifications</em>, or person has to negotiate
with you for special terms.

   <p>Another peculiar restriction that often comes up is allowing use and
modification but <em>requiring</em> the redistribution of any modified versions. 
The reason why this is a peculiar restriction is because at first sight,
it doesn't sound that bad; it does sound like free software. 
The advocates of this idea explain that there
are certain situations where it is very anti-social to make a useful
modification on a free program, use the program and benefit from it, and
not release it. However, if you legally require your users to
release any modifications they make, then this creates another problem,
especially when this requirement conflicts with privacy rights. 
The public should be free to redistribute your program, but they
should also be free to choose not to redistribute the program at all. 
The fundamental idea behind copylefted works is that they are owned by
the public. But, &ldquo;the public&rdquo; is the individual, as much as it is
the entire community. Copyleft protects the community by forbidding
hoarding, but the individual also deserves an equivalent protection;
the protection of both their privacy and their freedom.

   <p>Some developers, who do want to be part of our community, use licenses
that do not restrict any of our freedoms but which ask for a &ldquo;favor&rdquo;
from the user. An example of such a favor is to request that you change the
name of the program if you modify it, or to not use the name of some
organization in advertising. There is nothing ethically wrong with
asking for such favors. Requiring them legally however creates a serious
problem; it makes their terms incompatible with the terms of the GPL. 
It is very inefficient to inflict the price of such an incompatibility
on our community for the sake of a favor. Instead, in almost all cases, it
is just as good an idea to ask for such favors in the documentation
distributed with the program, where there is more latitude in what
restrictions you can impose
(see <a href="Why-free-software-needs-free-documentation.html#Why-free-software-needs-free-documentation">Why free software needs free documentation</a>).

   <p>Some people complain
that the GPL is &ldquo;too restrictive&rdquo; because it says no to software hoarding. 
They say that this makes the program &ldquo;less free&rdquo;. They say that
&ldquo;free flow of ideas&rdquo; means that you should not say no to anyone. 
If you would like to give your users more permissions, than provided by the
GPL, all you need to do is append the text of these permissions to the
copyright notices that you attach to every file; there is no need to
write a new license from scratch. You can do this, if you
are the original author of the file. For files that were written by
others, you need their permission. In general, however, doing this is not
a good idea.

   <p>The GPL has been very carefully thought-out to only give
permissions that give <em>freedom</em> to the users, without allowing any
permissions that would give <em>power</em> to some users to take freedom from
all of the other users. As a result, even though the terms say no to certain
things, doing so guarantees that the program remains free for all the users
in our community. The US constitution guarantees some of our rights by making
them <dfn>inalienable</dfn>. This means that no-one, not even the person
entitled to the rights, is allowed to waive them. For example, you can't
waive your right to freedom and sell yourself as a slave. While this can
be seen as a restriction in terms of what you are allowed to do, the effect is
that this restriction gives you more freedom. It is not <em>you</em> that
the restriction really is targetting, but all the people, that have power
over you, that might have an interest in taking your freedom away.

   <p>In many countries, other than the US, copyright law is not strictly
enforced. As a result, the citizens in these countries can afford not
to care about copyright. However, the free software community trascends
nations and borders, and many of us do not have the same latitude. 
So, if you write a program that you want to share with other people,
please be clear about the copyright terms. The easiest way to do this
is by applying the terms of the GPL.
