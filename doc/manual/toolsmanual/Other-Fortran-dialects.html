<h3 class="section">8.4 Other Fortran dialects</h3>

<p>There are many variants of Fortran like Fortran 90, and HPF. 
Fortran 90 attempts, quite miserably, to make Fortran 77 more like
C++. HPF allows engineers to write numerical code that runs on parallel
computers. These variants should be avoided for two reasons:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>There are no free compilers for Fortran 90 or HPF. 
If you happen to use a proprietary
operating system, you might as well make use of proprietary compilers
if they generate highly optimized code and that is important to you. 
Nevertheless, in order for your software to be free in a useful way, it
should be possible to compile it with free tools on a free operating system. 
A common objection is that since there are no parallel computers running
a free operating ysstem, the point is moot so one might as well use
HPF or Fortran 90, if doing so is convenient. 
This objection
is based on a premise that is now out of date. Nowadays, it is possible to
build parallel computers using commodity hardware, a modified
version of the Linux kernel, called Beowulf, and the GNU system. 
Parallelized software
can also be free. Therefore both Fortran 90 and HPF should be avoided,
whenever that is possible until we have a free compiler for them. 
<li>Another problem with these variants is that they are ad hoc languages
that have been invented to enable Fortran to do things that it can not
do by design. Eventually, when engineers will like to do things that Fortran
90 can't do either, it will be necessary to extend Fortran again, rewrite the
compilers and produce yet another variant. What engineers really need is
a <em>real</em> solid programming language, and a collection of well-designed
scientific libraries written in that language.
        </ol>
Please don't contribute to the spread of these dialects. Instead contribute
infrastructure to better languages, like C and C++, to support the features
that compell you to use Fortran 90 or HPF.
