<h3 class="section">4.6 Maintaining the documentation files</h3>

<p>Every software project must have its own directory. A minimal &ldquo;project&rdquo;
is the example that we described in
<a href="Hello-world-example-with-Autoconf-and-Automake.html#Hello-world-example-with-Autoconf-and-Automake">Hello world example with Autoconf and Automake</a>. In general,
even a minimal project must have the files:
<pre class="example">     README, INSTALL, AUTHORS, THANKS, NEWS, ChangeLog
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Before distributing your source code, it
is important to write the real contents of these files. 
In this section we give a summary overview
on how these files should be maintained. For more details, please see
the <em>GNU coding standards</em> as published by the FSF.

     <ul>
<li><strong>The README file:</strong>
Every distribution must contain this file. This is the file that the
installer must read <em>fully</em> after unpacking the distribution and
before configuring it. You should briefly explain the purpose of the
distribution, and reference all other documentation available. Instructions
for installing the package normally belong in the <samp><span class="file">INSTALL</span></samp> file. 
However if you have something that you feel the installer <em>should</em>
know then mention it in this file. Do not make the configuration or
installation process more complex, because you fear installers will not
<samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> files. Assume this file is being read.

     <p>For pretest releases, <em>only</em>, you might also decide to distribute
a file <samp><span class="file">README-alpha</span></samp> containing special comments for your friendly
pretesters. If you use the recommended version numbering scheme
(see <a href="Handling-version-numbers.html#Handling-version-numbers">Handling version numbers</a>), you can automate it's distribution
by adding the following code in your <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp>:
     <pre class="example">          changequote(,)dnl
          case $VERSION in
           [0-9]*.[0-9]*[a-z]) DIST_ALPHA="README-alpha";;
           [0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]*) DIST_ALPHA="README-alpha";;
           *) DIST_ALPHA=;;
          esac
          changequote([, ])dnl
          AC_SUBST(DIST_ALPHA)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">In your top-level <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp>, add something like:
     <pre class="example">          EXTRA_DIST = $(DIST_ALPHA)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"><li><strong>The INSTALL file:</strong>
Because the GNU installation procedure is streamlined, a standard
<samp><span class="file">INSTALL</span></samp> file will be created for you automatically by <code>Automake</code>. 
If you have something very important to say, it may be best to say it in
the <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> file instead. the <samp><span class="file">INSTALL</span></samp> file is mostly for
the benefit of people who've never installed a GNU package before. 
However, if your package is very unusual, you may decide that it is
best to modify the standard INSTALL file or write your own. 
<li><strong>The AUTHORS file:</strong>
This file should collect a trace of all the legal paperwork that you have
exchanged with contributors for your particular package. This information
is very useful for registering the copyright of your package. 
The file might have an introductory blurb similar to this one:
     <pre class="example">          Authors of PACKAGE
          
          The following contributions warranted legal paper exchanges
          with [the Free Software Foundation | Your Name].
          Also see files ChangeLog and THANKS
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Then, list who the
contributors are and what files they have worked on. Indicate whether
they created the file, or whether they modified it. 
For example:
     <pre class="example">          Random J. Hacker:
            entire files  -&gt; foo1.c , foo2.c , foo3.c
            modifications -&gt; foo4.c , foo5.c
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"><li><strong>The THANKS file:</strong>
All distributions should contain a <samp><span class="file">THANKS</span></samp> file containing
a two column list of the contributors, one per line, alphabetically
sorted. The left column gives the contributor's name, while the right
column gives the last known good email address for this contributor. 
This list should be introduced with a wording similar to this one:
     <pre class="example">          PACKAGE THANKS file
          
          PACKAGE has originally been written by ORIGINAL AUTHOR. Many
          people further contributed to PACKAGE by reporting problems,
          suggesting various improvements or submitting actual code.
          Here is a list of these people. Help me keep it complete and
          exempt of errors.
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">The easiest policy with this file is to thank everyone who contributes
to the project, without judging the value of the contribution.

     <p>Unlike <samp><span class="file">AUTHORS</span></samp>, the <samp><span class="file">THANKS</span></samp> file is not maintained for
legal reasons. It is maintained to thank all the contributors that
helped you out in your project. The <samp><span class="file">AUTHORS</span></samp> file can not be
used for this purpose because certain contributions, like bug reports
or ideas and suggestions do not require legal paper exchanges.

     <p>You can also decide to send some kind of special greeting when you
initially add a name to your <samp><span class="file">THANKS</span></samp> file. The mere presense
of a name in <samp><span class="file">THANKS</span></samp> is then a flag to you that the initial
greeting has been sent. 
<li><strong>The NEWS file:</strong>
List the major new features of this distribution and identify the
version that they pertain to. Don't discard items from previous
versions. Leave them in the file after the newer items, so that
a user upgrading from any previous version can see what is new. 
<li><strong>The ChangeLog file</strong>:
Use this file to record all the changes that you make to your source code. 
If your source code is distributed among many subdirectories, and there
is reason enough to think of the contents of the subdirectories as
different subpackages,then please maintain
a separate <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> file for each subdirectory. For example,
although there is usually no need to maintain a <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> for
your documentation, if you do decide to maintain one anyway, it should be
separate from your sources <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>.

     <p>The <em>GNU coding standards</em> explain in a lot of detail how you should
structure a <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>, so you should read about it there. 
The basic idea is to record <em>semi-permenant modifications</em> you make to
your source code. It is not necessary to continuously record changes
that you make while you are experimenting with something. But once you
decide that you got a modification worked out, then you should record
Please do record version releases on the central <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>
(see <a href="Handling-version-numbers.html#Handling-version-numbers">Handling version numbers</a>). 
This way, it will be possible to tell what changes happened between
versions.

     <p>You can automate <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> maintainance with emacs. 
See <a href="Navigating-source-code.html#Navigating-source-code">Navigating source code</a>, for more details. 
Recently versions of Emacs use
the ISO 8601 standard for dates which is: <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> (year-month-date). 
A typical <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> entry looks like this:
     <pre class="example">          1998-05-17  Eleftherios Gkioulekas  &lt;lf@amath.washington.edu&gt;
          
           * src/acmkdir.sh: Now acmkdir will put better default content
             to the files README, NEWS, AUTHORS, THANKS
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Every entry contains all the changes you made within the period of a day. 
The most recent changes
are listed at the top, the older changes slowly scroll to the bottom. 
Changes are sorted together in groups, per day of work. 
<li><strong>COPYING</strong>
This file contains the copyright permissions for your distribution,
in particular the General Public License
(see <a href="Licensing-Free-Software.html#Licensing-Free-Software">Licensing Free Software</a>). 
This file is generated automatically
for you by Automake. However, it requires that you insert copyright headers
in your source code that refer to this file. 
See <a href="Applying-the-GPL.html#Applying-the-GPL">Applying the GPL</a>, for more details.

     <p>Copyright is one of the many
legal concerns that you need to be aware of if you develop free software. 
See <a href="Legal-issues-with-Free-Software.html#Legal-issues-with-Free-Software">Legal issues with Free Software</a>, for more details. 
The philosophy of the GNU project, that software should be free, is
very important to the future of our community. 
See <a href="Philosophical-issues.html#Philosophical-issues">Philosophical issues</a>, to read Richard Stallman's essays on this topic.
