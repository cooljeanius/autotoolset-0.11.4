<h3 class="section">B.6 Confusing words</h3>

<p>There are a number of words and phrases which we recommend
avoiding, either because they are ambiguous or because they imply an
opinion that we hope you may not entirely agree with.

     <ul>
<li><strong>For free</strong>:
If you want to say that a program is free software, please don't say that
it is available &ldquo;for free.&rdquo; That term specifically means &ldquo;for zero price.&rdquo;
Free software is a matter of freedom, not price.

     <p>Free software is often available for free&ndash;for example, on many FTP
servers. But free software copies are also available for a price on
CD-ROMs, and proprietary software copies may occasionally be
available for free.

     <p>To avoid confusion, you can say that the program is available
&ldquo;as free software&rdquo;. 
<li><strong>Freeware</strong>:
Please don't use the term &ldquo;freeware&rdquo; as a synonym for &ldquo;free
software.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;freeware&rdquo; was used often in the 1980s for
programs released only as executables, with source code not available. 
Today it has no clear definition. 
<li><strong>Give away software</strong>:
It's misleading to use the term &ldquo;give away&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;distribute a
program as free software.&rdquo; It has the same problem as &ldquo;for free&rdquo;: it
implies the issue is price, not freedom. One way to avoid the confusion
is to say &ldquo;release as free software&rdquo;. 
<li><strong>Intellectual property</strong>:
Publishers and lawyers like to describe copyright as &ldquo;intellectual
property.&rdquo; This term carries a hidden assumption&mdash;that the most
natural way to think about the issue of copying is based on an analogy
with physical objects, and our ideas of them as property.

     <p>But this analogy overlooks the crucial difference between material
objects and information: information can be copied and shared almost
effortlessly, while material objects can't be. Basing your thinking on this
analogy is tantamount to ignoring that difference.

     <p>Even the US legal system does not entirely accept this analogy, since it
does not treat copyrights just like physical object property rights.

     <p>If you don't want to limit yourself to this way of thinking, it is best to
avoid using the term &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; in your words and thoughts.

     <p>Another problem with &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; is that it is an attempt
to generalize about several legal systems, including copyright, patents,
and trademarks, which are much more different than similar. Unless you have
studied these areas of law and you know the differences, lumping them
together will surely lead you to incorrect generalizations.

     <p>To avoid confusion, it is best not to look for alternative way
of saying &ldquo;intellectual property.&rdquo; Instead, talk about copyright, patents,
or whichever specific legal system is the issue. 
<li><strong>Piracy</strong>:
Publishers often refer to prohibited copying as &ldquo;piracy.&rdquo; In this way,
they imply that illegal copying is ethically equivalent to attacking ships
on the high seas, kidnaping and murdering the people on them.

     <p>If you don't believe that illegal copying is just like kidnaping and murder,
you might prefer not to use the word &ldquo;piracy&rdquo; to describe it. Neutral
terms such as &ldquo;prohibited copying&rdquo; or &ldquo;illegal copying&rdquo; are available
for use instead. Some of us might even prefer to use a positive term such
as &ldquo;sharing information with your neighbor.&rdquo;
<li><strong>Protection</strong>:
Publishers' lawyers love to use the term &ldquo;protection&rdquo; to describe
copyright. This word carries the implication of preventing destruction or
suffering; therefore, it encourages people to identify with the owner and
publisher who benefit from copyright, rather than with the users who are
restricted by it.

     <p>It is easy to avoid &ldquo;protection&rdquo; and use neutral terms instead. For
example, instead of &ldquo;Copyright protection lasts a very long time,&rdquo; you
can say, &ldquo;Copyright lasts a very long time.&rdquo;
<li><strong>Sell software</strong>:
The term &ldquo;sell software&rdquo; is ambiguous. Strictly speaking, exchanging a
copy of a free program for a sum of money is &ldquo;selling&rdquo;; but people
usually associate the term &ldquo;sell&rdquo; with proprietary restrictions on the
subsequent use of the software. You can be more precise, and prevent
confusion, by saying either &ldquo;distributing copies of a program for a fee&rdquo;
or &ldquo;imposing proprietary restrictions on the use of a program,&rdquo;
depending on what you mean. 
<li><strong>Theft</strong>:
Copyright apologists often use words like &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; and &ldquo;theft&rdquo; to
describe copyright infringement. At the same time, they ask us to treat
the legal system as an authority on ethics: if copying is forbidden, it
must be wrong.

     <p>So it is pertinent to mention that the legal system&ndash;at least in the
US&ndash;rejects the idea that copyright infringement is &ldquo;theft&rdquo;. Copyright
advocates who use terms like &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; are misrepresenting the
authority that they appeal to.

     <p>The idea that laws decide what is right or wrong is mistaken in general. 
Laws are, at their best, an attempt to achieve justice; to say that laws
define justice or ethical conduct is turning things upside down.
