<h2 class="appendix">Appendix B Philosophical issues</h2>

<p>The GNU development tools were written primarily to aid the development
and distribution of <dfn>free software</dfn> in the form of source code
distributions. 
The philosophy of the GNU project, that software should be free, is
very important to the future of our community. Now that free software
systems, like GNU/Linux, have been noticed by the mainstream media,
our community will have to face many challenges to our freedom. 
We may have a free
operating system today, but if we fail to deal with these challenges,
we will not have one tomorrow. What are these challenges? 
Three that we have already had to face are: secret hardware, non-free
libraries, and software patents. Who knows what else we might have to face
tomorrow. Will we respond to these challenges and protect our freedom? 
That depends on our philosophy.

   <p>In this appendix we include a few
articles written by Richard Stallman that discuss the philosophical concerns
that lead to the free software movement. The text of these articles is
