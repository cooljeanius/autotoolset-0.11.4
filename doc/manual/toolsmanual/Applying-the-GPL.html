<h3 class="section">4.8 Applying the GPL</h3>

<p>The General Public License (GPL) is the legal implementation of the idea that
the program, to which it is applied, belongs to the public. It means that
the public is free to use it, free to modify it and redistribute it. 
And it also means that no-one can steal it from the public and use it
to create a derived work that is not free. This is different from
<dfn>public domain</dfn>, where anyone can take a work, make a few changes,
slap a copyright notice on it, and forbid the public to use the resulting
work without a proprietary license. The idea, that a work is owned by the
public in this sense, is often called <dfn>copyleft</dfn>.

   <p>Unfortunately our legal system does not recognize this idea properly. 
Every work must have an <dfn>owner</dfn>, and that person or entity is the
only one that can enforce per copyright. As a result, when a work is
distributed under the GPL, with the spirit that it belongs to the public,
only the nominal &ldquo;owner&rdquo; has the right to sue hoarders that use
the work to create proprietary products. Unfortunately, the law does not
extend that right to the public. Despite this shortcoming, the GPL
has proven to be a very effective way to distribute free software. 
Almost all of the components of the GNU system are distributed under the
GPL.

   <p>To apply the GPL to your programs you need to do the following things:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Attach a copy of the GNU general public license to the toplevel directory of
your
source code in a file called <samp><span class="file">COPYING</span></samp>. 
<li>Include a legal notice to <em>every</em> file that you want covered by the GPL,
saying that it is covered by the GPL. It is important that all files that
constitute source code must include this notice, including <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp> files and shell scripts. 
The legal notice should look like this:
     <pre class="example">          Copyright (C) (years) (Your Name) &lt;your@email.address&gt;
          
          This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
          modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
          as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
          version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later
          version.
          
          This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
          but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
          MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
          GNU General Public License for more details.
          
          You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
          along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
          Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">If you have assigned your copyright to an organization, like the Free
Software Foundation, then you should probably fashion your copyright
notice like this:
     <pre class="example">          Copyright (C) (years) Free Software Foundation
          (your name) &lt;your@email.address&gt; (initial year)
          etc...
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">This legal notice works like a subroutine. By invoking it, you invoke the
full text of the GNU General Public License which is too lengthy to include
in every source file. Where you see &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(years)</span></samp>&rsquo; you need to list all the
years in which you finished preparing a version that was actually released,
and which was an ancestor to the current version. This list is
<em>not</em> the list of years in which versions were released. It is a list
of years in which versions, later released, were completed. If you finish
a version on Dec 31, 1997 and release it on Jan 1, 1998, you need to
include 1997, but you do not need to include 1998. This rule is complicated,
but it is dictated by international copyright law.

     <p>Some developers don't like inserting a proper legal notice to every file
in their source code, because they don't want to do the typing. 
However, it is not sufficient to just say something like
&ldquo;this file is GPLed&rdquo;. You have to make
an unambiguous and exact statement, and you have to include the entire
boilerplate text to do that. Fortunately, you can save typing by
having Emacs insert copyright notices for you. 
See <a href="Inserting-copyright-notices-with-Emacs.html#Inserting-copyright-notices-with-Emacs">Inserting copyright notices with Emacs</a>, for more details. 
<li>Use the <samp><span class="file">AUTHORS</span></samp> file to keep records of who wrote what. 
See <a href="Maintaining-the-documentation-files.html#Maintaining-the-documentation-files">Maintaining the documentation files</a>, for details. 
<li>If you modify someone else's GPL covered file make sure to comply with
section 2 of the GPL. To do that place notices stating that you changed
the file and the date of the change. Also your program should advertise the
fact that it is free software, that there is no warranty and that it can
be redistributed under the condition of the GPL. A standard way of doing
this is to make your program output this notice when it is passed the
<code>--version</code> command-line flag. 
<li>Finally, help others to use and improve your program by writing documentation. 
A free software project is not truly complete without documentation. 
To make it possible for your users to update the documentation to reflect
the changes that they make, it is necessary to make the documentation free
too. However, the issues for writings are different from the issues for
software. See <a href="Why-free-software-needs-free-documentation.html#Why-free-software-needs-free-documentation">Why free software needs free documentation</a>, for a
discussion of these issues. See <a href="Maintaining-Documentation.html#Maintaining-Documentation">Maintaining Documentation</a>, for the
technical details on how to write documentation for your programs.
