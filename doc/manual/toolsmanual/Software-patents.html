<h3 class="section">A.2 Software patents</h3>

<p>In addition to copyright law, there is another legal beast: the patent law. 
Unlike copyright, which you own automatically by the act of creating the work,
you don't get a patent unless you file an application for it. If approved,
the work is published but others must pay you royalties in order to use it
in any way.

   <p>The problem with patents is that they cover algorithms, and
if an algorithm is patented you can neither write nor use an implementation
for it, without a license. 
What makes it worse is that it is very difficult and expensive to
find out whether the algorithms that you use are patented or will be
patented in the future. What makes it insane is that the patent office,
in its infinite stupidity, has patented algorithms that are very trivial
with nothing innovative about them. For example, the use of
<dfn>backing store</dfn> in a multiprocesing window system, like X11, is
covered by patent 4,555,775. In the spring of 1991, the owner of the
patent, AT&amp;T, threatened to sue every member of the X Consortium including
MIT. Backing store is the idea that the windowing system save the contents of
all windows at all times. This way, when a window is covered by another
window and then exposed again, it is redrawn by the windowing system, and
not the code responsible for the application. Other insane patents include
the IBM patent 4,674,040 which covers &ldquo;cut and paste between files&rdquo; in
a text editor. Recently, a stupid corporation called &ldquo;Wang&rdquo; tried to take
Netscape to court over a patent that covered &ldquo;bookmarks&rdquo; and lost.

   <p>Even though this situation is ridiculous, software patents are
a very serious problem because they are taken very seriously by the
judicial system. Unfortunately they are not taken equally seriously
by the patent office (also called PTO) itself. The more patents the PTO
approves, the more income the PTO makes. Therefore, the PTO is very eager
to let dubious patents through. After all, they figure that if the patent
is invalid, someone will knock it down in court eventually.

   <p>It is not necessary for someone to have a solid case
to get you into trouble. The cost of litigation is often sufficient extortion
to force small bussinesses, non-profit organizations and individual software
developers to settle, even when there is not solid case. The only defense
against a patent attac is to prove that there is &ldquo;prior art&rdquo;; in other
words, you need to show that what is described in the patent had already
been invented before the date on which the application for that patent was
filed. Unfortunately, this is costly, not guaranteed to work, and
the burden of proof rests with the victim of the attack. Another
defense is to make sure you don't have a lot of money. If you are poor,
lawyers are less likely to waste money suing you.

   <p>Companies like to use software patents as strategic weapons for applying
extortion, which is unfortunately sanctioned by the law. They build
an arsenal of software patents by trying to pass whatever can get
through the Patent Office. Then years later, when they feel like it,
they can go through their patent arsenal and find someone to sue and
extort some cash.

   <p>There have actually been patent attacks aimed directly against the free
sofwtare community. The GNU system does not include the Unix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">compress</span></samp>&rsquo;
utility because it infringes a patent, and the patent owner has specifically
targetted the volunteer that wrote a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">compress</span></samp>&rsquo; program for the
GNU project. 
There may be more patent attacks in the future. 
On November of 1998 two
internal memos were leaked from Microsoft about our community. According to
these memos, Microsoft perceives the free software community as a competitor
and they seem to consider a patent-based attack among other things. 
It is important to note however that when an algorithm is patented,
and, worse, when that patent is asserted by the owner, this is an
attack on <em>everyone</em> that writes software, not only to the free
software community. This is why it is not important who is being targetted
in each specific incident. Patents hurt all of us.
