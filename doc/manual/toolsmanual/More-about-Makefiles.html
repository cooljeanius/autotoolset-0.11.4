<h3 class="section">3.8 More about Makefiles</h3>

<p>Now let's consider a more complicated example. Suppose that we want to
build a program <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> whose source code is four source files
<pre class="example">     foo1.c, foo2.c, foo3.c, foo4.c
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and three header files:
<pre class="example">     gleep1.h, gleep2.h, gleep3.h
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Suppose also, for the sake of argument, that
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li><samp><span class="file">foo1.c</span></samp> includes <samp><span class="file">gleep2.h</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">gleep3.h</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">foo2.c</span></samp> includes <samp><span class="file">gleep1.h</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">foo3.c</span></samp> includes <samp><span class="file">gleep1.h</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">gleep2.h</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">foo4.c</span></samp> includes <samp><span class="file">gleep3.h</span></samp>
        </ol>
To build the executable file <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp>, we need to build the
object files <samp><span class="file">foo1.o</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">foo2.o</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">foo3.o</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">foo4.o</span></samp>
that correspond to the source files and link them together. 
If any of the <samp><span class="file">*.c</span></samp> files is modified, then only the corresponding
object file and the executable need to be updated. However, if one
of the header files is modified, then all the object files whose corresponding
<samp><span class="file">*.c</span></samp> file includes the modified header file should be rebuilt. 
It follows that each of the object files depends on the corresponding
<samp><span class="file">*.c</span></samp> file and all the header files that that file includes. 
We get then the following <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>:
<pre class="example">     foo: foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o foo4.o
     &lt;TAB&gt; gcc -o foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o foo4.o
     
     foo1.o: foo1.c gleep2.h gleep3.h
     &lt;TAB&gt; gcc -c foo1.c
     
     foo2.o: foo2.c gleep1.h
     &lt;TAB&gt; gcc -c foo2.c
     
     foo3.o: foo3.c gleep1.h gleep2.h
     &lt;TAB&gt; gcc -c foo3.c
     
     foo4.o: foo4.c gleep3.h
     &lt;TAB&gt; gcc -c foo4.c
     
     clean:
     &lt;TAB&gt; rm -f foo foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o foo4.o
     
     install: foo
     &lt;TAB&gt; mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
     &lt;TAB&gt; rm -f /usr/local/bin/foo
     &lt;TAB&gt; cp foo /usr/local/bin/foo
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This idea can be easily generalized for any program. If you would like
to build more than one programs, then you should add a phony target
in the beginning that depends on the programs that you want to build. 
The usual way we do this is by adding a line like
<pre class="example">     all: prog1 prog2 prog3
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to the beginning of the <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>.

   <p>Unfortunately, this <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> has a lot of unnecessary redundancy:
     <ul>
<li>All object files get built the same way. It would be nice then, if
we didn't have to write a rule for every one of them and instead
describe how it's done in general. 
<li>If we decide to change the compiler used, we would would need to edit
the <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> in 6 places. It should be easier than that. 
<li>The list of object files <code>foo1.o, ..., foo4.o</code> appears in at least
two places. 
<li>The directory name <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/bin</span></samp> appears in two places. 
</ul>
   This redundancy can be eliminated by using <dfn>makefile variables</dfn> and
<dfn>abstract rules</dfn>.

     <ul>
<li><dfn>Makefile variables</dfn> are actually more like macro definitions. 
The syntax for defining a <dfn>makefile variable</dfn> is:
     <pre class="example">          <var>variable</var> = <var>value</var>
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Then, in every other rule or variable definition, the symbol
<var>$(variable)</var> is substituted with <var>value</var>.

     <li>An <dfn>abstract rule</dfn> is a definition that explains how to build a
file <samp><span class="file">*.</span><var>s2</var></samp> from a file <samp><span class="file">*.</span><var>s1</var></samp>, where <var>s1</var>
and <var>s2</var> are suffixes. The general syntax for an abstract rule is:
     <pre class="example">          .<var>s1</var>.<var>s2</var>:
          &lt;TAB&gt; <span class="sc">Command</span>
          &lt;TAB&gt; <span class="sc">Command</span>
          &lt;TAV&gt; .....
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">where <var>s1</var> is the suffix of the source file, and <var>s2</var> is the
suffix of the corresponded generated file and <span class="sc">Command</span> is the set
of commands that generate <samp><span class="file">*.</span><var>s2</var></samp> from  <samp><span class="file">*.</span><var>s1</var></samp>. 
Note that no dependencies are mentioned, because dependencies don't
make sense in the general case. They must be explicitly provided for
each individual case separately. 
</ul>
   In the context of an abstract rule, the following punctuation marks have
the following meanings:
     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>are the dependencies that changed causing the target to need to be rebuilt
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$@</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>is the target
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$^</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>are <em>all</em> the dependencies for the current rule
</dl>
   For example, the abstract rule for building an object file from a source
file is:
<pre class="example">     .c.o:
     &lt;TAB&gt; gcc -c $&lt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Similarly, the rule for building the executable file from a set of
object files is:
<pre class="example">     .o:
     &lt;TAB&gt; gcc $^ -o $@
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that because executables don't have a suffix, we only mention the
suffix of the object files. When only one suffix appears, it is
assumed that it is suffix <var>s1</var> and that suffix <var>s2</var> is the
empty string.

   <p>The suffixes involved in your abstract rules, need to be listed in
a directory tha takes the form:
<pre class="example">     .SUFFIXES: <var>s1</var> <var>s2</var> ... <var>sn</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>s1</var>, <var>s2</var>, etc. are suffixes. Also,
if you've written an abstract rule, you still need to write rules
where you mention the specific targets and their dependencies, except
that you can omit the command-part since they are covered by the abstract
rule.

   <p>Putting all of this together, we can enhance our <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> like
this:
<pre class="example">     CC = gcc
     CFLAGS = -Wall -g
     OBJECTS = foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o foo4.o
     PREFIX = /usr/local
     
     .SUFFIXES: .c .o
     
     .c.o:
     &lt;TAB&gt; $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $&lt;
     
     .o:
     &lt;TAB&gt; $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $^ -o $@
     
     foo: $(OBJECTS)
     foo1.o: foo1.c gleep2.h gleep3.h
     foo2.o: foo2.c gleep1.h
     foo3.o: foo3.c gleep1.h gleep2.h
     foo4.o: foo4.c gleep3.h
     
     clean:
     &lt;TAB&gt; rm -f $(OBJECTS)
     
     install: foo
     &lt;TAB&gt; mkdir -p $(PREFIX)/bin
     &lt;TAB&gt; rm -f $(PREFIX)/bin/foo
     &lt;TAB&gt; cp foo $(PREFIX)/bin/foo
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The only part of this Makefile that still requires some thinking on your
part, is the part where you list the object files and their dependencies:
<pre class="example">     foo1.o: foo1.c gleep2.h gleep3.h
     foo2.o: foo2.c gleep1.h
     foo3.o: foo3.c gleep1.h gleep2.h
     foo4.o: foo4.c gleep3.h
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note however, that in principle even that can be automatically generated. 
Even though the <samp><span class="file">make</span></samp> utility does not understand C source code
and can not determine the dependencies, the GNU C compiler can. 
If you use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-MM</span></samp>&rsquo; flag, then the compiler will compute and output
the dependency lines that you need to include in your Makefile. For example:
<pre class="example">     % gcc -MM foo1.c
     foo1.o: foo1.c gleep2.h gleep3.h
     % gcc -MM foo2.c
     foo2.o: foo2.c gleep1.h
     % gcc -MM foo3.c
     foo3.o: foo3.c gleep1.h gleep2.h
     % gcc -MM foo4.c
     foo4.o: foo4.c gleep3.h
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Unfortunately, unlike all the other compiler features we have described
up until now, this feature is not portable in Unix. If you have installed
the GNU compiler on your Unix system however, then you can also do this.

   <p>Dealing with dependencies is one of the major drawbacks of writing
makefiles by hand. Another drawback is that even though
we have moved many of the parameters to makefile variables, these
variables still need to be adjusted by somebody. There is something
rude about asking the installer to edit <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>. 
Developers that ask their users to edit <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> make their
user's life more difficult in an unacceptable way. Yet another annoyance
is writing <code>clean</code>, <code>install</code> and such targets. Doing so every
time you write a makefile gets to be tedious on the long run. Also,
because these targets are, in a way, mission critical, it is really important
not to make mistakes when you are writing them. Finally, if you want
to use multiple directories for every one of your libraries and
programs, you need to setup your makefiles to recursively
call &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo; on the subdirectories, write a whole lot of makefiles,
and have a way of propagating configuration information to every one of
these makefiles from a centralized source.

   <p>These problems are not impossible to deal with, but you need a lot of
experience in makefile writing to overcome them. Most developers don't
want to bother as much with all this, and would rather be debugging
ther source code. The GNU build system helps you set up your source code
to make this possible. For the same example, the GNU developer only needs to
write the following <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> file:
<pre class="example">     bin_PROGRAMS = foo
     foo_SOURCES = foo1.c foo2.c foo3.c foo4.c
     noinst_HEADERS = gleep1.h gleep2.h gleep3.h
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and set a few more things up. This file is then compiled into an
intermediate file, called <samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp>, by Automake, and during
installation the final <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> is generated from <samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp>
by a shell script called <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp>. This shell script is provided
by the developer and it is also automatically generated with Autoconf. 
For more details see
<a href="Hello-world-example-with-Autoconf-and-Automake.html#Hello-world-example-with-Autoconf-and-Automake">Hello world example with Autoconf and Automake</a>.

   <p>In general you will not need to be writing makefiles by hand. It is
useful however to understand how makefiles work and how to write
abstract rules.
