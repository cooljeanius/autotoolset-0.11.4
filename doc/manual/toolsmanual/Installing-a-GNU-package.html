<h3 class="section">1.1 Installing a GNU package</h3>

<p>Autoconfiguring software is distributed with packaged source code
distributions. These are big files with filenames of the form:
<pre class="example">     <var>package</var>-<var>version</var>.tar.gz
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For example, the file <samp><span class="file">autoconf-2.13.tar.gz</span></samp> contains
version 2.13 of GNU Autoconf. 
We often call these
files <dfn>source distributions</dfn>; sometimes we simply call them
<dfn>packages</dfn>.

   <p>The steps for installing an autoconfiguring source code distribution are
simple, and if the distribution is not buggy, can be carried out without
substantial user intervention.
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>First, you have to unpack the package to a directory:
     <pre class="example">          % gunzip foo-1.0.tar.gz
          % tar xf foo-1.0.tar
</pre>
     <p>This will create the directory <samp><span class="file">foo-1.0</span></samp> which contains the package's
source code and documentation. Look for the files <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> to see
if there's anything that you should do next. The <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> file might
suggest that you need to install other packages before installing this one,
or it might suggest that you have to do unusual things to install this
package. If the source distribution conforms to the GNU coding standards,
you will find many other documentation files like <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp>. 
See <a href="Maintaining-the-documentation-files.html#Maintaining-the-documentation-files">Maintaining the documentation files</a>, for an explanation of what
these files mean. 
<li>Configure the source code. Once upon a time that used to mean that you have
to edit makefiles and header files. In the wonderful world of Autoconf,
source distributions provide a <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> script that will do that
for you automatically. To run the script type:
     <pre class="example">          % ./configure
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"><li>Now you can compile the source code. Type:
     <pre class="example">          % cd foo-1.0
          % make
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">and if the program is big, you can make some coffee. After the program
compiles, you can run its regression test-suite, if it has one,
by typing
     <pre class="example">          % make check
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"><li>If everything is okey, you can install the compiled distribution with:
     <pre class="example">          % su
          # make install
</pre>
     </ol>

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">make</span></samp> program launches the shell commands necessary for compiling,
testing and installing the package from source code. However, <samp><span class="file">make</span></samp>
has no knowledge of what it is really doing. It takes its orders from
<dfn>makefiles</dfn>, files called <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> that have to be present
in every subdirectory of your source code directory tree. From the installer
perspective,
the makefiles define a set of <dfn>targets</dfn> that correspond to things
that the installer wants to do. The default target is always compiling the
source code, which is what gets invoked when you simply run <code>make</code>. 
Other targets, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">install</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">check</span></samp>&rsquo; need to be mentioned
explicitly. Because <samp><span class="file">make</span></samp> takes its orders from the makefile in
the current directory, it is important to run it from the correct
directory. See <a href="Compiling-with-Makefiles.html#Compiling-with-Makefiles">Compiling with Makefiles</a>, for the full story behind
<samp><span class="file">make</span></samp>.

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> program is a shell script that probes your system
through a set of tests to
determine things that it needs to know, and then uses the results
to generate <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> files from templates stored
in files called <samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp>. In the early days of the GNU project,
developers used to write <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> scripts by hand. Now, no-one
ever does that any more. Now, <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> scripts are automatically
generated by GNU Autoconf from an input file <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp>. 
GNU Autoconf is part of the GNU build system and we first introduce
in in <a href="The-GNU-build-system.html#The-GNU-build-system">The GNU build system</a>.

   <p>As it turns out, you don't have to write the <samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp> templates
by hand either. Instead you can use another program, GNU Automake, to
generate <samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp> templates from higher-level descriptions
stored in files called <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp>. In these files you describe
what is being created by your source code, and Automake computes the
makefile targets for compiling, installing and uninstalling it. Automake
also computes targets for compiling and running test suites, and targets
for recursively calling <code>make</code> in subdirectories. The details about
Automake are first introduced in <a href="Using-Automake.html#Using-Automake">Using Automake</a>.
