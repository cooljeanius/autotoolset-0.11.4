<h3 class="section">1.4 Doing a VPATH build</h3>

<p>Autoconfiguring source distributions also support vpath builds. In a
vpath build, the source distribution is stored in a, possibly read-only,
directory, and the actual building takes place in a different directory
where all the generated files are being stored. We call the first
directory, the <dfn>source tree</dfn>, and the second directory the
<dfn>build tree</dfn>. The build tree may be a subdirectory of the source tree,
but it is better if it is a completely separate directory.

   <p>If you, the developer, use the standard features of the GNU build system, you
don't need to do anything special to allow your packages to support vpath
builds. The only exception to this is when you define your own make rules
(see <a href="General-Automake-principles.html#General-Automake-principles">General Automake principles</a>). Then you have to follow certain
conventions to allow vpath to work correctly.

   <p>You, the installer, however do need to do something special. You need
to install and use GNU make. Most Unix make utilities do not support
vpath builds, or their support doesn't work. GNU make is extremely portable,
and if vpath is important to you, there is no excuse for not installing it.

   <p>Suppose that <samp><span class="file">/sources/foo-0.1</span></samp> contains a source distribution,
and you want to build it in the directory <samp><span class="file">/build/foo-0.1</span></samp>. 
Assuming that both directories exist, all you have to do is:
<pre class="example">     % cd /build/foo-0.1
     % /sources/foo-0.1/configure <var>...options...</var>
     % make
     % make check
     % su
     # make install
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The configure script and the generated makefiles will take care of the rest.

   <p>vpath builds are prefered by some people for the following reasons:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>They prevent the build process form cluttering your source directory
with all sorts of build files. 
<li>To remove a build, all you have to do is remove the build directory. 
<li>You can build the same source multiple times using different options. 
This is very useful if you would like to write a script that will
run the test suite for a package while the package is configured in
many different ways (e.g. different features, different compiler optimization,
and so on). It is also useful if you would like to do the same with releasing
binary distributions of the source.
        </ol>
Some developers like to use vpath builds all the time. Others use them
only when necessary. 
In general, if a source distribution builds with a vpath build, it also
builds under the ordinary build. The opposite is not true however. 
This is why the <code>distcheck</code> target checks if your distribution is
correct by attempting a vpath build.
