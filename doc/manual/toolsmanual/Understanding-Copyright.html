<h3 class="section">A.1 Understanding Copyright</h3>

<p>When you create an original work, like a computer program, or a novel, and so
on, the government automatically grants you a set of legal rights called
<dfn>copyright</dfn>. 
Copyright is the right to obstruct others from <em>using</em>, <em>modifying</em>
and <em>redistributing</em> your work. Anyone that would like to use, modify
or redistribute your work needs to enter an agreement with you. By granting
you this monopoly, the government limits the freedom of the public to
express themselves in ways that involve infringing your copyright. The
government justifies copyright by claiming that it is a bargain that
benefits the public because it encourages the creation of more works. 
<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
The holder of the copyright, called the <dfn>&ldquo;owner&rdquo;</dfn>, is the only person
that can enforce per copyright.

   <p>Copyright ownership can be transfered to another person or organization. 
When a work is being developed by a team, it
makes legal sense to transfer the copyright to a single organization that
can then coordinate enforcement of the copyright. In the free software
community, some people assign their software to the Free Software Foundation. 
The arrangement is that copyright is transfered to the FSF. The FSF then
grants you all the rights back in the form of a license agreement, and
commits itself legally to distributing the work only as free software. 
If you want to do this, you should contact the FSF for more information. 
It is not a good idea to assign your copyright to anyone else, unless you
know what you are getting into. By assigning you rights to someone and
not getting any of those rights back in the form of an agreement, you may place
yourself in a position where you are not allowed to use your own work. 
Unfortunately, if you are employed or a student in a University you have
probably already signed many of your rights away. Universities as well as
companies like to lay as much claim on any copyrightable work you produce
as possible, even work that you do as a hobby that has little to do with
them.

   <p>Because copyright does not allow your users to do much with your software,
other than have a copy, you need to give them permissions that allow them
to freely use, modify and redistribute it. 
In the free software community, we standardize on using
a legal document, the <dfn>GNU General Public License</dfn> to grant such
permissions. 
See <a href="Applying-the-GPL.html#Applying-the-GPL">Applying the GPL</a>, for more details on how to use the GPL.

   <p>Copyright covers mainly original works. However, it also introduces the
concept of <dfn>derived works</dfn>. In general, if someone copies a portion
of your work into per work, then it becomes <dfn>derived work</dfn> of your
work, and both you and person share copyright interest on per work.

   <p>If the only information that you give an impartial observer is a copy of
your work and a copy of per work, the observer has no deterministic
way of deciding whether or not per work is legally derived from your work. 
The legal term <dfn>derived work</dfn> refers to the <em>process</em> with
which person created per work, rather than an actual inherent property
of the end-result of the effort. 
Your copyright interest is established by
the fact that part of that process involved <em>copying</em> some of your
work into per work (and then perhaps modifying it, but that is not
relevant to whether or not you have copyright interest).

   <p>So, if you and someone write two very similar programs, because the
programs are simple, then you don't have copyright interest in each others
work, because you both worked indepedently. If, however, the reason for the
similarity is that person copied your work, then you have copyright interest
on per work. 
When that happens, person can only distribute the resulting program
(i.e. source code, or the executable) under terms that are consistent
with the terms with which person was allowed to have a copy of your work
and use it in per program.

   <p>The law is less clear about what happens if person refers to your work
without actually doing any copying. A judge will have to decide this if it
goes to court. This is why when you work on a free software project,
the only way to avoid liabilities like this is by not refering to anyone
else's work, unless per work is also free software. This is one of the many
ways that copyright obstructs cooperation between citizens.

   <p>Fortunately there is a legal precedent with derived work and user interfaces. 
The courts have decided that user interfaces, such as the
<dfn>application programming interface</dfn> (API) that a software library is
exporting to the programs that link to it can not be copyrighted. So,
if you want to clone a library, while it is not a good idea to refer
to the actual source code of the library, it is okey to refer to a
description of the interface that the library defines. It is best to
do this by reading the documentation, but if no documentation is available,
reading the header files is the next best thing.

   <p>The concept of derived work is very slippery ground and has many gray
areas, especially when it pertains to linking libraries that other
people have written to your programs. 
See <a href="The-GPL-and-libraries.html#The-GPL-and-libraries">The GPL and libraries</a>, for more discussion on this issue.
