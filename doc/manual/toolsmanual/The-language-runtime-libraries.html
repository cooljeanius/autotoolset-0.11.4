<h3 class="section">3.6 The language runtime libraries.</h3>

<p>When you compile ordinary programs, like the hello world program the
compiler will automatically link to your program a library called
<samp><span class="file">libc.a</span></samp>. So when you type
<pre class="example">     % gcc -c hello.c
     % gcc -o hello hello.o
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">what is actually going on behind the scenes is:
<pre class="example">     % gcc -c hello.c
     % gcc -o hello hello.c -lc
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">To see why this is necessary, try &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nm</span></samp>&rsquo; on <samp><span class="file">hello.o</span></samp>:
<pre class="example">     % nm hello.o
     00000000 t gcc2_compiled.
     00000000 T main
              U printf
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The file <samp><span class="file">hello.o</span></samp> defines the symbol &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">main</span></samp>&rsquo;, but it marks the
symbol &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">printf</span></samp>&rsquo; as undefined. The reason for this is that
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">printf</span></samp>&rsquo; is not a built-in keyword of the C programming language,
but a function call that is defined by the <samp><span class="file">libc.a</span></samp> library. Most of the
facilities of the C programming language are defined by this library. 
The include files <samp><span class="file">stdio.h</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">stdlib.h</span></samp>, and so on are only
header files that declare parts of the C library. You can read
all about the C library in the <cite>Libc manual</cite>.

   <p>The catch is that there are many functions that you may consider standard
features of C that are not included in the <samp><span class="file">libc.a</span></samp> library itself. 
For example, all the math functions that are declared in <samp><span class="file">math.h</span></samp>
are defined in a library called <samp><span class="file">libm.a</span></samp> which is <em>not</em> linked
by default. So if your program is using math functions and including
<samp><span class="file">math.h</span></samp>, then you need to explicitly link the math library by
passing the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-lm</span></samp>&rsquo; flag. The reason for this particular separation is
that mathematicians are very picky about the way their math is being
computed and they may want to use their own implementation of the math
functions instead of the standard implementation. If the math functions
were lumped into <samp><span class="file">libc.a</span></samp> it wouldn't be possible to do that.

   <p>For example, consider the following program that prompts for a number
and prints its square root:
     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="file">dude.c</span></samp><dd>
     <pre class="example">          #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
          #include &lt;math.h&gt;
          
          int
          main ()
          {
            double a;
            printf ("a = ");
            scanf ("%f", &amp;a);
            printf ("sqrt(a) = %f", sqrt(a));
          }
</pre>
     </dl>
   To compile this program you will need to do:
<pre class="example">     % gcc -o dude dude.c -lm
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">otherwise you will get an error message from the linker about <code>sqrt</code>
being an unresolved symbol.

   <p>On GNU, the <samp><span class="file">libc.a</span></samp> library is very comprehensive. On many Unix systems
however, when you use system-level features you may need to link additional
system libraries such as
<samp><span class="file">libbsd.a</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">libsocket.a</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">libnsl.a</span></samp>, etc. 
If you are linking C++ code, the C++ compiler will link
both <samp><span class="file">libc.a</span></samp> and the C++ standard library <samp><span class="file">libstdc++.a</span></samp>. 
If you are also using GNU C++ features however, you will explicitly need to
link <samp><span class="file">libg++.a</span></samp> yourself. 
Also if you are linking Fortran and C code together
you must also link the Fortran run-time libraries. These libraries
have non-standard names and depend on the Fortran compiler that you use. 
(see <a href="Using-Fortran-effectively.html#Using-Fortran-effectively">Using Fortran effectively</a>)
Finally, a very common problem is encountered when you are writing
X applications. The X libraries and header files like to be placed in
non-standard locations so you must provide system-dependent <code>-I</code>
and <code>-L</code> flags so that the compiler can find them. Also the most
recent version of X requires you to link in some additional libraries
on top of <code>libX11.a</code> and some rare systems require you to link
some additional system libraries to access networking features
(recall that X is built on top of the sockets interface and it is essentially a
communications protocol between the computer running the program and
computer that controls the screen in which the X program is displayed.) 
<em>FIXME: Crossreferences, if we explain all this in more details</em>.

   <p>Because it is necessary to link system libraries to form an executable,
under copyright law, the executable is derived work from the system libraries. 
This means that you must pay attention to the license terms of these libraries. 
The GNU <samp><span class="file">libc</span></samp> library is under the LGPL license which allows you to
link and distribute both free and proprietary executables. The <samp><span class="file">stdc++</span></samp>
library is also under terms that permit the distribution of proprietary
executables. The <samp><span class="file">libg++</span></samp> library however only permits you to build
free executables. If you are on a GNU system, including Linux-based GNU
systems, the legalese is pretty straightforward. If you are on a proprietary
Unix system, you need to be more careful. The GNU GPL does not allow
GPLed code to be linked against proprietary library. Because on Unix systems,
the system libraries are proprietary, their terms also may not allow you to
distribute executables derived from them. In practice, they do however,
since proprietary Unix systems do want to attract proprietary applications. 
In the same spirit, the GNU GPL also makes an exception and explicitly
permits the linking of GPL code with proprietary system libraries, provided
that these libraries are a major component of the operating system
(i.e. they are part of the compiler, or the kernel, and so on),
<strong>unless</strong> the copy of the library itself accompanies the executable!

   <p>This includes
proprietary <samp><span class="file">libc.a</span></samp> libraries, the <samp><span class="file">libdxml.a</span></samp> library in
Digital Unix, proprietary Fortran system libraries like <samp><span class="file">libUfor.a</span></samp>,
and the X11 libraries.
