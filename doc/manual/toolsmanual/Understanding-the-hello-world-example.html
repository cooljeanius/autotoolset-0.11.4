<h3 class="section">4.4 Understanding the hello world example</h3>

<p>When you made the <samp><span class="file">hello-0.1.tar.gz</span></samp> distribution, most of the files
were automatically generated. The only files that were actually written
by your fingers were:
     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="file">hello.c</span></samp><dd>
     <pre class="example">          #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
          main()
          {
           printf("Howdy, world!\n");
          }
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"><br><dt><samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp><dd>
     <pre class="example">          bin_PROGRAMS = hello
          hello_SOURCES = hello.c
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"><br><dt><samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp><dd>
     <pre class="example">          AC_INIT(hello.cc)
          AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(hello,1.0)
          AC_PROG_CC
          AC_PROG_INSTALL
          AC_OUTPUT(Makefile)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"></dl>
   In this section we explain briefly what the files <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp> mean.

   <p>The language of <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> is a <dfn>logic language</dfn>. There is no
explicit statement of execution. Only a statement of relations from which
execution is inferred. On the other hand, the language of <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp>
is <dfn>procedural</dfn>. Each line of <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp> is a command that
is executed.

   <p>Seen in this light, here's what the <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp> commands shown do:
     <ul>
<li>The <code>AC_INIT</code> command initializes the configure script. It must be
passed as argument the name of one of the source files. Any source file
will do. 
<li>The <code>AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE</code> performs some further initializations that are
related to the fact that we are using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">automake</span></samp>&rsquo;. If you are writing
your <samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp> by hand, then you don't need to call this command. 
The two comma-separated arguments are the name of the package and the
version number. 
<li>The <code>AC_PROG_CC</code> checks to see which C compiler you have. 
<li>The <code>AC_PROG_INSTALL</code> checks to see whether your system has a BSD
compatible install utility. If not then it uses <samp><span class="file">install-sh</span></samp> which
<samp><span class="file">automake</span></samp> will install at the root of your package directory if it's
not there yet. 
<li>The <code>AC_OUTPUT</code> tells the configure script to generate <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>
from <samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp>
</ul>

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> is more obvious. The first line specifies the name
of the program we are building. The second line specifies the source files
that compose the program.

   <p>For now, as far as <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp> is concerned you need to know
the following additional facts:
     <ul>
<li>If you are building a library, then your configure script must determine
how to handle &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ranlib</span></samp>&rsquo;. To do that, add the <code>AC_PROG_RANLIB</code>
command. 
<li>If your source code contains C++ files, you need to add the
<code>AC_PROG_CXX</code> to your <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp>. 
<li>If your source code contains &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">yacc</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lex</span></samp>&rsquo; files,
then you need to add:
     <pre class="example">          AC_PROG_YACC
          AC_PROG_LEX
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">to your <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp>. 
<li>If your source code contains Fortran source code, you need to add
<samp><span class="file">AC_PROG_FC</span></samp> to your code. If you want to mix C and Fortran,
then you need to do a lot more than just that. 
See <a href="Using-Fortran-effectively.html#Using-Fortran-effectively">Using Fortran effectively</a>, for more details. 
<li>If you have any makefiles in subdirectories you must also put them in the
<code>AC_OUTPUT</code> statement like this:
     <pre class="example">          AC_OUTPUT(Makefile          \
                    dir1/Makefile     \
                    dir2/Makefile     \
                   )
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Note that the backslashes are not needed if you are using the bash shell. 
For portability reasons, however, it is a good idea to include them. 
Make sure that <em>every</em> subdirectory where building takes place,
is mentioned! 
</ul>

   <p>Now consider the commands that are used to build the hello world distribution:
<pre class="example">     % aclocal
     % autoconf
     % touch README AUTHORS NEWS ChangeLog
     % automake -a
     % ./configure
     % make
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first three commands bring the package in autoconfiscated state. The
remaining two commands do the actual configuration and building. More
specifically:
     <ul>
<li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">aclocal</span></samp>&rsquo; command installs a file called <samp><span class="file">aclocal.m4</span></samp>. Normally,
in that file you are supposed to place the definitions of any &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">autoconf</span></samp>&rsquo;
macros that you've written that happen to be in use in <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp>. 
We will teach you how to write &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">autoconf</span></samp>&rsquo; macros later. 
The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">automake</span></samp>&rsquo; utility uses the <code>AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE</code> macro which is
not part of the standard &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">autoconf</span></samp>&rsquo; macros. For this reason, it's
definition needs to be placed in <samp><span class="file">aclocal.m4</span></samp>. If you call &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">aclocal</span></samp>&rsquo;
with no arguments then it will generate the appropriate <samp><span class="file">aclocal.m4</span></samp> file. 
Later we will show you how to use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">aclocal</span></samp>&rsquo; to also install your
own &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">autoconf</span></samp>&rsquo; macros. 
<li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">autoconf</span></samp>&rsquo; command combines the <samp><span class="file">aclocal.m4</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp> files and produces the <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> script. 
And now we are in bussiness. 
<li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">touch</span></samp>&rsquo; command makes the files <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> and friends exist. 
It is important that these files exist before calling Automake, because
Automake decides whether to include them in a distribution by checking
if they exist at the time that you invoke &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">automake</span></samp>&rsquo;. Automake
<em>must</em> decide to include these files, because when you type
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make distcheck</span></samp>&rsquo; the presense of these files will be required. 
<li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">automake</span></samp>&rsquo; command compiles a <samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp> file from
<samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> and if absent it installs various files that are required
either by the GNU coding standards or by the makefile that will be generated. 
</ul>

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> script probes your platform and generates makefiles
that are customized for building the source code on your platform. The
specifics of how the probing should be done are programmed in
<samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp>. The generated makefiles are based on templates
that appear in <samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp> files. In order for these templates
to cooperate with <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> and produce makefiles that conform
to the GNU coding standards they need to contain a tedious amount of boring
stuff. This is where Automake comes in. Automakes generates the
<samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp> files from the more terse description in
<samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp>. As you have seen in the example, <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp>
files can be very simple in simple cases. Once you have customized makefiles,
your make utility takes over.

   <p>How does <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> actually convert the template <samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp>
to the final makefile? The <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> script really does
two things:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>It maintains a list of <dfn>substitutions</dfn> that it accumulates while
probing the installer platform. Each one of these substitutions consists
of a symbolic name, and the actual text that we want to substitute. 
When the <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> script runs <code>AC_OUTPUT</code> it parses
all of the files listed in <code>AC_OUTPUT</code> and every occurance of
<code>@FOO@</code> in these files is substituted with the text that corresponds
to <code>FOO</code>. For example, if you add the following lines to
<samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp> you will cause <code>@FOO@</code> to be substituted with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hello</span></samp>&rsquo;:
     <pre class="example">          FOO="hello"
          AC_SUBST(FOO)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">This is how <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp>
exports compile-time decisions to the makefile, such as what compiler
to use, what flags to pass the compilers and so on. 
Occasionally, you want to use <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp>'s substitution capability
directly on files that are not makefiles. This is why it is important
to be aware of it. 
See <a href="Scripts-with-Automake.html#Scripts-with-Automake">Scripts with Automake</a>, for an example. 
<li>It maintains a list of C preprocessor macros with defined values that it
also accumulates while probing the installer platforms. Before finishing
off, <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> will either generate a configuration file that defines
these C preprocessor macros to the desired values, or set a flag in
the generated makefile (through substitution) that will pass &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-D</span></samp>&rsquo;
flags to the compiler. We discuss configuration headers in the
following
        </ol>
See <a href="Writing-Autoconf-macros.html#Writing-Autoconf-macros">Writing Autoconf macros</a>, for more details on the internals of
<samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> scripts.
