<h3 class="section">3.3 Building libraries</h3>

<p>In many cases a collection of object files form a logical unit that is used
by more than one executable. On both GNU and Unix systems, it is possible
to collect such object files and form a <dfn>library</dfn>. On the GNU system,
to create a library, you use the <samp><span class="file">ar</span></samp> command:
<pre class="example">     ar cru libfoo.a foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This will create a file <samp><span class="file">libfoo.a</span></samp> from the object files
<samp><span class="file">foo1.o</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">foo2.o</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">foo3.o</span></samp>. The suffix
<samp><span class="file">*.a</span></samp> is reserved for object file libraries. 
Before using the library, it needs to be &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; by a program
called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ranlib</span></samp>&rsquo;:
<pre class="example">     % ranlib libfoo.a
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The GNU system, and most Unix systems require that you run <samp><span class="file">ranlib</span></samp>,
but there have been some Unix systems where doing so is not necessary. 
In fact there are Unix systems, like some versions of SGI's Irix, that don't
even have the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ranlib</span></samp>&rsquo; command!

   <p>The reason for this is historical. Originally <code>ar</code>
was meant to be used merely for packaging files together. The more
well known program <code>tar</code> is a descendent of <code>ar</code> that was designed
to handle making such archives on a tape device. Now that tape devices are
more or less obsolete, <code>tar</code> is playing the role that was originally
meant for <code>ar</code>. As for <code>ar</code>, way back, some people thought to
use it to package <code>*.o</code> files. However the linker wanted a symbol table
to be passed along with the archive. So the <code>ranlib</code>
program was written to generate that table and add it to the <code>*.a</code> file. 
Then some Unix vendors thought that if they incorporated <code>ranlib</code>
to <code>ar</code> then users wouldn't have to worry about forgetting to call
<code>ranlib</code>. So they provided <code>ranlib</code> but it did nothing. Some
of the more evil ones dropped it all-together breaking many people's scripts.

   <p>Once you have a library, you can link it with other object files just
as if it were an object file itself. For example
<pre class="example">     % gcc bar.o libfoo.a -o foo
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">using <samp><span class="file">libfoo.a</span></samp> as defined above, is equivalent to writing
<pre class="example">     % gcc bar.o foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o -o foo
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Libraries are particularly useful when they are <dfn>installed</dfn>. 
To install a library you need to move the file <samp><span class="file">libfoo.a</span></samp> to
a standard directory. The actual location of that directory depends
on your compiler. The GNU compiler looks for installed libraries in
<samp><span class="file">/usr/lib</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/lib</span></samp>. Because many Unix systems
also use the GNU compiler, it is safe to say that both of these
directories are standard in these systems too. However there are
some Unix compilers that don't look at <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/lib</span></samp> by default. 
Once a library is installed, it can be used in any project from any
current directory to compile an executable that uses the subroutines that
that library provides. You can direct the compiler to link an installed
library with a set of executable files to form an executable by using
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-l</span></samp>&rsquo; flag like this:
<pre class="example">     % gcc -o foo bar.o -lfoo
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that if the filename of the library is <samp><span class="file">libfoo.a</span></samp>, the
corresponding argument to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-l</span></samp>&rsquo; flag must be only the substring
<samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp>, hence &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-lfoo</span></samp>&rsquo;. Libraries must be named with names
that have the form <samp><span class="file">lib*.a</span></samp>. If you have installed the <samp><span class="file">libfoo.a</span></samp>
library in a non-standard directory, you can tell the linker to look
for the library in that directory as well by using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-L</span></samp>&rsquo; flag. 
For example, if the library was installed in <samp><span class="file">/home/lf/lib</span></samp> then
we would have to invoke the linking like this:
<pre class="example">     gcc -o bar bar.o -L/home/lf/lib -lfoo
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-L</span></samp>&rsquo; flag must appear before the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-l</span></samp>&rsquo; flag.

   <p>Some people
like to pass &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-L.</span></samp>&rsquo; to the compiler so they can link uninstalled
libraries in the current working directory using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-l</span></samp>&rsquo; flag
instead of typing in their full filenames. The idea is that they think
&ldquo;it looks better&rdquo; that way. Actually this is considered bad style. 
You should use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-l</span></samp>&rsquo; flag to link only libraries that have already
been installed and use the full pathnames to link in uninstalled libraries. 
The reason why this is important is because, even though it makes no
difference when dealing with ordinary libraries, it makes a lot of
difference when you are working with <dfn>shared</dfn> libraries. 
(<em>FIXME: Crossreference</em>). 
It makes a difference whether or not you are linking
to an uninstalled or installed <em>shared</em> library, and in that case
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-l</span></samp>&rsquo; semantics mean that you are linking an installed shared
library. Please stick to this rule, even if you are not
using shared libraries, to make it possible to switch to using shared
libraries without too much hassle.

   <p>Also, if you are linking in more than one library,
please pay attention to the order with which you link your libraries. 
When the linker links a library, it does not embed into the executable code
the entire library, but only the symbols that are needed from the library. 
In order for the linker to know what symbols are really needed from any
given library, it must have already parsed all the other libraries and
object files that depend on that library! This implies that you
first link your object files, then you link the higher-level libraries,
then the lower-level libraries. If you are the author of the libraries,
you must write your libraries in such a manner, that the dependency graph
of your libraries is a tree. If two libraries depend on each other
bidirectionally, then you may have trouble linking them in. This suggests that
they should be one library instead!
