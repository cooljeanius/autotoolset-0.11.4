<h3 class="section">2.4 Using vi emulation</h3>

<p>Many hackers prefer to use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vi</span></samp>&rsquo; editor. The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vi</span></samp>&rsquo; editor is
the standard editor on Unix. It is also always available on GNU/Linux. 
Many system administrators find it necessary to use vi, especially when they
are in the middle of setting up a system in which Emacs has not been
installed yet. Besides that, there are many compelling reasons why people
like vi.
     <ul>
<li>Vi requires only two special keys: the &lt;SHIFT&gt; key and the &lt;ESC&gt;
key. All the other keys that you need are standard on all keyboards. 
You do not need &lt;CTRL&gt;,&lt;ALT&gt;,the cursor keys or any of the function
keys. Some terminals that miss the escape key, usually have the control
key and you can get escape with:
<kbd>&lt;CTRL&gt;-[</kbd> <!-- } -->
<li>Vi was designed to deal with terminals that connect to mainframes over
a very slow line. So it has been optimized to allow you to do the most
editing possible with the fewest keystrokes. This allows users to edit
text very efficiently. 
<li>Vi allows your fingers to stay at the center of the keyboard, with the
occasional hop to the escape key. It does not require you to stretch your
fingers in funny control combinations, which makes typing less tiring
and more comfortable. 
</ul>
   Because most rearrangements of finger habits are not as optimal as the
vi finger habits, most vi users react very unpleasently to other editors. 
For the benefit of these users, in this section we describe how to
run a vi editor under the Emacs system. Similarly, users of other editors
find the vi finger habits strange and unintuitive. For the benefit of
these users we describe briefly how to use the vi editor, so they can
try it out if they like.

   <p>The vi emulation package for the Emacs system is called <dfn>Viper</dfn>. 
To use Viper, add the following lines in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>:
<pre class="example">     (setq viper-mode t)
     (setq viper-inhibit-startup-message 't)
     (setq viper-expert-level '3)
     (require 'viper)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">We recommend expert level 3, as the most balanced blend
of the vi editor with the Emacs system. Most editing modes are aware of
Viper, and when you begin editing the text you are immediately thrown into
Viper. Some modes however do not do that. In some modes, like the Dired mode,
this is very appropriate. In other modes however, especially custom modes
that you have added to your system, Viper does not know about them, so
it does not configure them to enter Viper mode by default. To tell a
mode to enter Viper by default, add a line like the following to
your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file:
<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'm4-mode-hook 'viper-mode)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The modes that you are most likely to use during software development are
<pre class="example">     c-mode  , c++-mode , texinfo-mode
     sh-mode , m4-mode  , makefile-mode
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Sometimes, Emacs will enter Viper mode by default in modes where you prefer
to get Emacs modes. In some versions of Emacs, the
<code>compilation-mode</code> is such a mode. To tell a mode <strong>not</strong> to
enter Viper by default, add a line like the following to your
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file:
<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'compilation-mode-hook 'viper-change-state-to-emacs)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The Emacs distribution has a Viper manual. For more details on setting
Viper up, you should read that manual.

   <p>The vi editor has these things called <em>editing modes</em>. An editing
mode defines how the editor responds to your keystrokes. Vi has three
editing modes: <dfn>insert mode</dfn>, <dfn>replace mode</dfn> and <dfn>command mode</dfn>. 
If you run Viper, there is also the Emacs mode. Emacs indicates which
mode you are in by showing one of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;I&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;R&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;V&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;E&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; on the statusbar
correspondingly for the Insert, Replace, Command and Emacs modes. 
Emacs also shows you the mode by the color of the cursor. This makes it
easy for you to keep track of which mode you are in.
     <ul>
<li><dfn>Insert mode</dfn>:
When you are in insert mode, the editor simply <dfn>inserts</dfn> the things that
you type into the text that is being editted. If there are any characters
in front of your cursor, these characters are pushed ahead and they are
not overwritten. Under Viper, when you are in insert mode, the color
of your cursor is green. The only key that has special meaning, while you
are in insert mode is &lt;ESC&gt;. If you press the escape key, you are taken
to <dfn>command mode</dfn>. 
<li><dfn>Replace mode</dfn>:
When you are in replace mode, the editor replaces the text under the cursor
with the text that is being typed. So, you want insert mode when you want
to write over what's already written. Under Viper, when you are in
replace mode, the color of your cursor is red. The &lt;ESC&gt; will take you
to <dfn>command mode.</dfn>
<li><dfn>Command mode</dfn>:
When you are in command mode, every letter key that you press is a command
and has a special meaning. Some of these keys allow you to navigate the
text. Other keys allow you to enter either insert or replace mode. 
And other keys do various special things. Under Viper, when you are in
command mode, the color of your cursor is white. 
<li><dfn>Emacs mode</dfn>:
When you are in Emacs mode, then Viper is turned off on the specific
buffer, and Emacs behaves as the default Emacs editor. 
You can switch between Emacs mode and Command mode by pressing
<kbd>&lt;CTRL&gt;-z</kbd>. So to go to Emacs mode, from Insert of Replace mode, you
need to go through Command mode. When you are dealing with a buffer that
runs a special editing mode, like Dired,
Emacs defines a specialized &ldquo;command mode&rdquo; for manipulating that buffer,
that can be completely different from the canonical Viper command mode. 
You want to be in that mode to access the intended functionality. Occasionally
however, you may like to hop to viper's command mode to navigate the buffer,
do a search or save the buffer's contents. When you hop to one of the
other three modes, the buffer will suddendly be just text to your editor. 
</ul>
   While you are in Command mode, you can prepend keystrokes with a number. 
Then the subsequent keystroke will be executed as many times as the number. 
We now list the most important keystrokes that are available to you,
while you are in Viper's command mode:
     <ul>
<li>The following keystrokes allow you to navigate the cursor around your text
without making any changes on the text itself
          <dl>
<dt><kbd>h</kbd><dd>moves one character to the left
<br><dt><kbd>j</kbd><dd>moves down one line
<br><dt><kbd>k</kbd><dd>moves up one line
<br><dt><kbd>l</kbd><dd>moves one character to the left
<br><dt><kbd>w</kbd><dd>moves forward one word
<br><dt><kbd>5w</kbd><dd>moves forward five words (get the idea?) 
<br><dt><kbd>b</kbd><dd>moves back one word
<br><dt><kbd>0</kbd><dd>moves to the beginning of the current line
<br><dt><kbd>$</kbd><dd>moves to the end of the current line
<br><dt><kbd>G</kbd><dd>moves to the last line in the file
<br><dt><kbd>1G</kbd><dd>moves to the first line in the file
<br><dt><kbd>:10</kbd><dd>moves to line 10 in the file (get the idea?) 
<br><dt><kbd>{</kbd><dd>moves up one paragraph
<br><dt><kbd>}</kbd><dd>moves down one paragraph
</dl>
     <li>The following keystrokes allow you to delete text
          <dl>
<dt><kbd>x</kbd><dd>Deletes the character under the cursor
<br><dt><kbd>dd</kbd><dd>Deletes the current line
<br><dt><kbd>4dd</kbd><dd>Deletes four lines
<br><dt><kbd>dw</kbd><dd>Deletes the current word
<br><dt><kbd>8dw</kbd><dd>Deletes the next eight words
</dl>
     <li>The following keystrokes allow you to enter Insert mode
          <dl>
<dt><kbd>a</kbd><dd>Append text after the cursor position
<br><dt><kbd>i</kbd><dd>Insert text at the current cursor position
<br><dt><kbd>o</kbd><dd>Insert text on a new line bellow the current line
<br><dt><kbd>O</kbd><dd>Insert text on a new line above the current line
</dl>
     <li>The following keystrokes allow you to enter Replace mode.
          <dl>
<dt><kbd>R</kbd><dd>Replace text at the cursor position and stay in Replace mode. 
<br><dt><kbd>s</kbd><dd>Replace (substitute) only the character at the cursor position, and
enter Insert mode for all subsequent characters. 
</dl>
     <li>The following commands handle file input/output. All of these commands
are prepended by the <kbd>:</kbd> character. The <kbd>:</kbd> character is used
for commands that require many characters to be properly expressed. 
The full text of these commands is entered in the minibuffer. Under viper,
the minibuffer itself can run under insert, replace and command mode. 
By default you get insert mode, but you can switch to command mode
by pressing &lt;ESC&gt;.
          <dl>
<dt><kbd>:w</kbd><dd>Save the file to the disk
<br><dt><kbd>:w!</kbd><dd>Force the file to be saved to disk even when file permissions do not allow
it but you have the power to overrule the permissions. 
<br><dt><kbd>:w </kbd><var>filename</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Save the file to the disk under a specific filename. 
When you press &lt;SPACE&gt; Emacs inserts the full pathname of the current
directory for you, which you can edit if you like. 
<br><dt><kbd>:w! </kbd><var>filename</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Force the file to be saved to the disk under a specific filename. 
<br><dt><kbd>:r </kbd><var>filename</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Paste a file from the disk at the cursor's current position. 
<br><dt><kbd>:W</kbd><dd>Save all the files on all the Emacs buffers that correspond to open files. 
<br><dt><kbd>:q</kbd><dd>Kill the buffer. This does not quite the editor at expert level 3. 
<br><dt><kbd>:q!</kbd><dd>Kill the buffer even if the contents are not saved. Use with caution! 
</dl>
     <li>The following commands handle search and replace
          <dl>
<dt><kbd>/</kbd><var>string</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Search for <var>string</var>. 
<br><dt><kbd>n</kbd><dd>Go to the next occurance of <var>string</var>. 
<br><dt><kbd>N</kbd><dd>Go to the previous occurance of <var>string</var>. 
<br><dt><kbd>:%s/</kbd><var>string1</var><kbd>/</kbd><var>string2</var><kbd>/g &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Replace all occurances of <var>string1</var> with <var>string2</var>. 
Use this with extreme caution! 
</dl>
     <li>The following commands handle <dfn>undo</dfn>
          <dl>
<dt><kbd>u</kbd><dd>Undo the previous change. Press again to undo the undo
<br><dt><kbd>.</kbd><dd>Press this if you want to repeat the undo further. 
</dl>
     </ul>
   These are enough to get you started. Getting used to dealing with the modes
and learning the commands is a matter of building finger habits. It may take
you a week or two before you become comfortable with Viper. When Viper
becomes second nature to you however, you won't want to tolerate what you
used to use before.
