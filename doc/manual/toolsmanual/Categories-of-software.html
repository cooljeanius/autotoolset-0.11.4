<h3 class="section">B.5 Categories of software</h3>

<p>Here is a glossary of various categories of software that are often
mentioned in discussions of free software. It explains which categories
overlap or are part of other categories.

     <ul>
<li><strong>Free software</strong>:
Free software is software that comes with permission for
anyone to use, copy, and distribute, either verbatim or with
modifications, either gratis or for a fee. In particular, this means
that source code must be available. &ldquo;If it's not source, it's not
software.&rdquo;

     <p>If a program is free, then it can potentially be included in a free
operating system such as GNU, or free GNU/Linux systems .

     <p>There are many different ways to make a program free&mdash;many
questions of detail, which could be decided in more than one way
and still make the program free. Some of the possible variations
are described below.

     <p>Free software is a matter of freedom, not price. But proprietary
software companies sometimes use the term &ldquo;free software&rdquo; to
refer to price. Sometimes they mean that you can obtain a binary
copy at no charge; sometimes they mean that a copy is included
on a computer that you are buying. This has nothing to do with
what we mean by free software in the GNU project.

     <p>Because of this potential confusion, when a software company
says its product is free software, always check the actual
distribution terms to see whether users really have all the
freedoms that free software implies. Sometimes it really is free
software; sometimes it isn't.

     <p>Many languages have two separate words for &ldquo;free&rdquo; as in
freedom and &ldquo;free&rdquo; as in zero price. For example, French has
&ldquo;libre&rdquo; and &ldquo;gratuit&rdquo;. English has a word &ldquo;gratis&rdquo; that refers
unambiguously to price, but no common adjective that refers
unambiguously to freedom. This is unfortunate, because such a
word would be useful here.

     <p>Free software is often more reliable than non-free software. 
<li><strong>Open Source software</strong>:
The term &ldquo;open source&rdquo; software is used by some people to
mean more or less the same thing as free software. 
<li><strong>Public domain software</strong>:
Public domain software is software that is not copyrighted. It is
a special case of non-copylefted free software, which means
that some copies or modified versions may not be free at all.

     <p>Sometimes people use the term &ldquo;public domain&rdquo; in a loose
fashion to mean &ldquo;free&rdquo; or &ldquo;available gratis.&rdquo; However, &ldquo;public
domain&rdquo; is a legal term and means, precisely, &ldquo;not
copyrighted&rdquo;. For clarity, we recommend using &ldquo;public domain&rdquo;
for that meaning only, and using other terms to convey the other
meanings. 
<li><strong>Copylefted software</strong>:
Copylefted software is free software whose distribution terms
do not let redistributors add any additional restrictions when
they redistribute or modify the software. This means that every
copy of the software, even if it has been modified, must be free
software.

     <p>In the GNU Project, we copyleft almost all the software we
write, because our goal is to give every user the freedoms
implied by the term &ldquo;free software.&rdquo; See Copylefted for more
explanation of how copyleft works and why we use it.

     <p>Copyleft is a general concept; to actually copyleft a program, you
need to use a specific set of distribution terms. There are many
possible ways to write copyleft distribution terms. 
<li><strong>Non-copylefted free software</strong>:
Non-copylefted free software comes from the author with
permission to redistribute and modify, and also to add additional
restrictions to it.

     <p>If a program is free but not copylefted, then some copies or
modified versions may not be free at all. A software company
can compile the program, with or without modifications, and
distribute the executable file as a proprietary software product.

     <p>The X Window System illustrates this. The X Consortium
releases X11 with distribution terms that make it
non-copylefted free software. If you wish, you can get a copy
which has those distribution terms and is free. However, there
are non-free versions as well, and there are popular
workstations and PC graphics boards for which non-free
versions are the only ones that work. If you are using this
hardware, X11 is not free software for you. 
<li><strong>GPL-covered software</strong>:
The GNU GPL is one
specific set of distribution terms for copylefting a program. The
GNU Project uses it as the distribution terms for most GNU
software. 
<li><strong>The GNU system</strong>:
The GNU system is a complete free Unix-like operating system.

     <p>A Unix-like operating system consists of many programs. We
have been accumulating components for this system since 1984;
the first test release of a &ldquo;complete GNU system&rdquo; was in 1996. 
We hope that in a year or so this system will be mature enough
to recommend it for ordinary users.

     <p>The GNU system includes all the GNU software, as well as
many other packages such as the X Window System and TeX
which are not GNU software.

     <p>Since the purpose of GNU is to be free, every single component
in the GNU system has to be free software. They don't all have
to be copylefted, however; any kind of free software is legally
suitable to include if it helps meet technical goals. We can and
do use non-copylefted free software such as the X Window
System. 
<li><strong>GNU software</strong>:
GNU software is software that is released under the auspices of
the GNU Project. Most GNU software is copylefted, but not all;
however, all GNU software must be free software.

     <p>Some GNU software is written by staff of the Free Software
Foundation, but most GNU software is contributed by
volunteers. Some contributed software is copyrighted by the
Free Software Foundation; some is copyrighted by the
contributors who wrote it. 
<li><strong>Semi-free software</strong>:
Semi-free software is software that is not free, but comes with
permission for individuals to use, copy, distribute, and modify
(including distribution of modified versions) for non-profit
purposes. PGP is an example of a semi-free program.

     <p>Semi-free software is much better than proprietary software,
but it still poses problems, and we cannot use it in a free
operating system.

     <p>The restrictions of copyleft are designed to protect the essential
freedoms for all users. For us, the only justification for any
substantive restriction on using a program is to prevent other
people from adding other restrictions. Semi-free programs have
additional restrictions, motivated by purely selfish goals.

     <p>It is impossible to include semi-free software in a free operating
system. This is because the distribution terms for the operating
system as a whole are the conjunction of the distribution terms
for all the programs in it. Adding one semi-free program to the
system would make the system as a whole just semi-free. There
are two reasons we do not want that to happen:
          <ul>
<li>We believe that free software should be for
everyone&ndash;including businesses, not just schools and
hobbyists. We want to invite business to use the whole
GNU system, and therefore we must not include a
semi-free program in it. 
<li>Commercial distribution of free operating systems,
including Linux-based GNU systems, is very important,
and users appreciate being able to buy commercial
CD-ROM distributions. Including one semi-free
program in an operating system would cut off
commercial CD-ROM distribution for it. 
</ul>
     The Free Software Foundation itself is non-commercial, and
therefore we would be legally permitted to use a semi-free
program &ldquo;internally&rdquo;. But we don't do that, because that would
undermine our efforts to obtain a program which we could also
include in GNU.

     <p>If there is a job that needs doing with software, then until we
have a free program to do the job, the GNU system has a gap. 
We have to tell volunteers, &ldquo;We don't have a program yet to do
this job in GNU, so we hope you will write one.&rdquo; If we ourselves
used a semi-free program to do the job, that would undermine
what we say; it would take away the impetus (on us, and on
others who might listen to our views) to write a free
replacement. So we don't do that. 
<li><strong>Proprietary software</strong>:
Proprietary software is software that is not free or semi-free. 
Its use, redistribution or modification is prohibited, or requires
you to ask for permission, or is restricted so much that you
effectively can't do it freely.

     <p>The Free Software Foundation follows the rule that we cannot
install any proprietary program on our computers except
temporarily for the specific purpose of writing a free replacement
for that very program. Aside from that, we feel there is no
possible excuse for installing a proprietary program.

     <p>For example, we felt justified in installing Unix on our computer
in the 1980s, because we were using it to write a free
replacement for Unix. Nowadays, since free operating systems
are available, the excuse is no longer applicable; we have
eliminated all our non-free operating systems, and any new
computer we install must run a completely free operating
system.

     <p>We don't insist that users of GNU, or contributors to GNU,
have to live by this rule. It is a rule we made for ourselves. But
we hope you will decide to follow it too. 
<li><strong>Freeware</strong>:
The term &ldquo;freeware&rdquo; has no clear accepted definition, but it is
commonly used for packages which permit redistribution but not
modification (and their source code is not available). These
packages are not free software, so please don't use &ldquo;freeware&rdquo;
to refer to free software. 
<li><strong>Shareware</strong>:
Shareware is software which comes with permission for people
to redistribute copies, but says that anyone who continues to
use a copy is required to pay a license fee.

     <p>Shareware is not free software, or even semi-free. There are
two reasons it is not:
          <ul>
<li>For most shareware, source code is not available; thus you cannot modiy the
program at all. 
<li>Shareware does not come with permission to make a
copy and install it without paying a license fee, not even
for individuals engaging in nonprofit activity. (In
practice, people often disregard the distribution terms
and do this anyway, but the terms don't permit it.) 
</ul>

     <li><strong>Commercial Software</strong>:
Commercial software is software being developed by a business
which aims to make money from the use of the software. 
&ldquo;Commercial&rdquo; and &ldquo;proprietary&rdquo; are not the same thing! Most
commercial software is proprietary , but there is commercial free
software, and there is non-commercial non-free software.

     <p>For example, GNU Ada is always distributed under the terms of
the GNU GPL, and every copy is free software; but its
developers sell support contracts. When their salesmen speak to
prospective customers, sometimes the customers say, &ldquo;We
would feel safer with a commercial compiler.&rdquo; The salesmen
reply, &ldquo;GNU Ada is a commercial compiler; it happens to be free
software.&rdquo;

     <p>For the GNU Project, the emphasis is in the other order: the
important thing is that GNU Ada is free software; whether it is
commercial is not a crucial question. However, the additional
development of GNU Ada that results from the business that
supports it is definitely beneficial. 
</ul>
