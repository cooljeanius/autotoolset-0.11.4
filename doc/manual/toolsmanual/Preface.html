<h2 class="unnumbered">Preface</h2>

<p>The GNU project was founded in 1984 by Richard Stallman in response to the
increasing obstacles to cooperation imposed on the computing community
by the owners of proprietary software. The goal of the GNU project is
to remove these obstacles by developing a complete software system,
named GNU <a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> and
distributing it as free software. GNU is not about software that costs
$0. It is about software that gives to all its users the freedom to
use, modify and redistribute it. These freedoms are essential to
building a community based on cooperation and the open sharing of ideas.

   <p>Today, millions of people use GNU/Linux, a combination of the GNU system
and the popular Linux kernel that was developed since 1991 by Linus Torvalds
and a group of volunteers. 
The GNU project's kernel, the Hurd, is also in service but it is not yet
sufficiently developed for widespread use. Technically, Unix and GNU
have many similarities, and it is very easy to port software from Unix
to GNU or use GNU software on Unix systems.

   <p>Because GNU is a community effort, it provides very powerful development
tools that enable every user to contribute to the community by writing
free software. The GNU development tools include the <dfn>GNU compilers</dfn>,
the <dfn>GNU build system</dfn> and <dfn>Emacs</dfn>. 
Proprietary systems often do not bundle such tools with their distributions
because their developers regard the users as a market that buys software
licenses and treats the computer as an appliance. 
<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>

   <p>This manual will introduce you to the development tools that are used
in the GNU system. These tools can also be used to develop software with
GNU/Linux and Unix. 
This manual will not teach you how to use C, or any other programming
language. It is assumed that you are already familiar with C. This manual
will also not cover every detail about the tools that we discuss. 
Each tool has its own reference manual, and you should also read these
manuals, sooner or later, if you want to learn more. This manual aims to
be a practical introduction to the GNU development tools that will show
you how to use them together to accomplish specific common tasks. 
The intended audience is a programmer that has learned programming in C,
and would now like to learn everything else that person needs to know to
develop software that conforms to the GNU coding standards. So,
we will tell you what to need to know, and then you can read the specific
reference manuals to learn everything that you can possibly learn.

<h3 class="heading">Note on terminology</h3>

<p>There is a growing concern among womyn that there are important gender
issues with the English language. As a result, it became common to use terms
such as &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;. 
In this manual we will use the words <dfn>person</dfn>,
<dfn>per</dfn>, <dfn>pers</dfn> and <dfn>perself</dfn>. These words are used just
like the words she, her, hers, herself. For example, we will say:
&ldquo;person wrote a manual to feel good about perself, and to encourage per
potential significant other's heart to become pers&rdquo;. These terms were
introduced, and
perhaps invented, by Marge Piercy, and have been first used in software
documentation and email correspondance by Richard Stallman. 
By using these terms, we hope to make this manual less threatening to
womyn and to encourage our womyn readers to join the free software community.

<h3 class="heading">Roadmap to manual</h3>

<p>This manual was written as a tutorial and not a reference manual,
so in general, it works to read the chapters in the order in which they
are presented. If you came fresh from your CS courses with a good knowledge
of C, but have learned nothing about the GNU development tools, reading
all the chapters in order is probably what you should do. 
However, if you are already familiar with some of the
topics that we discuss, you might want to skip a few chapters to get to
the material that is new to you.

   <p>For example, many readers are already
familiar with Emacs and Makefiles, and they just want to get
started with learning about Autoconf and Automake. In that case,
you can skip to <a href="The-GNU-build-system.html#The-GNU-build-system">The GNU build system</a>, and start reading from there. 
If you are a vi user and are not interested in learning Emacs, please
reconsider (see <a href="Using-vi-emulation.html#Using-vi-emulation">Using vi emulation</a>). You will find some of the other
development tools, especially the Texinfo documentation system, much easier
to use with Emacs than without it.

   <p>Here's a brief outline of the chapters in this manual, and what is covered
by each chapter.
     <ul>
<li><a href="Installing-GNU-software.html#Installing-GNU-software">Installing GNU software</a>, explains how to install free software
that is distributed in autoconfiguring source distributions. The rest of
the manual will tell you what you need to know to make your software
autoconfiguring as well. 
<li><a href="Using-GNU-Emacs.html#Using-GNU-Emacs">Using GNU Emacs</a>, shows you how to install and configure Emacs,
and how to use it to develop and maintain your software. 
<li><a href="Compiling-with-Makefiles.html#Compiling-with-Makefiles">Compiling with Makefiles</a>, introduces the compiler and the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo;
utility and explains how to write Makefiles. 
<li><a href="The-GNU-build-system.html#The-GNU-build-system">The GNU build system</a>, explains how to develop
simple programs with Automake and Autoconf. 
<li><a href="Using-Automake.html#Using-Automake">Using Automake</a>, explains in a lot more detail how to write sophisticated
<samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> files. 
<li><a href="Using-Libtool.html#Using-Libtool">Using Libtool</a>, explains how to use Libtool to write portable source
distributions that compile shared libraries both on GNU and Unix. 
<li><a href="Using-C-effectively.html#Using-C-effectively">Using C effectively</a>, explains how to make the best use of the GNU
build system to develop C programs. 
<li><a href="Using-Fortran-effectively.html#Using-Fortran-effectively">Using Fortran effectively</a>, explains how to write programs that use
both Fortran and C. 
<li><a href="Internationalization.html#Internationalization">Internationalization</a>, explains how to write programs whose user
interface can be translated to foreign languages. 
<li><a href="Maintaining-Documentation.html#Maintaining-Documentation">Maintaining Documentation</a>, explains how to document your software
using Texinfo, LaTeX and man pages. 
<li><a href="Portable-shell-programming.html#Portable-shell-programming">Portable shell programming</a>, explains how to write portable shell
scripts. This is essential to writing your own Autoconf macros. 
<li><a href="Writing-Autoconf-macros.html#Writing-Autoconf-macros">Writing Autoconf macros</a>, explains how to write your own Autoconf macros. 
<li><a href="Legal-issues-with-Free-Software.html#Legal-issues-with-Free-Software">Legal issues with Free Software</a>, discusses legal issues such as
software copyrights, patents and governmental stupidity. 
Understanding these issues is essential in keeping your free software free
and protecting it from hoarders. If you are publishing free software to our
community it is very important to understand the law, even if in your country
copyrights and patents are not strictly enforced. 
<li><a href="Philosophical-issues.html#Philosophical-issues">Philosophical issues</a>, is a collection of articles by Richard Stallman
that discuss the free software philosophy. Our philosophy is very important,
because it is what will motivate us to keep free software free, and
defend our freedom now that the free software movement has been noticed
by the mainstream media. 
<li><a href="Licensing-Free-Software.html#Licensing-Free-Software">Licensing Free Software</a>, is another collection of articles that
contain advice about licensing free software. Most of these articles,
except for one, have also been written by Richard Stallman. 
</ul>
