<h3 class="section">2.3 Configuring GNU Emacs</h3>

<p>To use Emacs effectively for software development you need to configure it. 
Part of the configuration needs to be done in your X-resources file. 
On a Debian GNU/Linux system, the X-resources can be configured by editing
<pre class="example">     /etc/X11/Xresources
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In many systems, you can configure X-resources by editing a file called
<samp><span class="file">.Xresources</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">.Xdefaults</span></samp> on your home directory, but
that is system-dependent. The configuration that I use on my system
is:
<pre class="example">     ! Emacs defaults
     emacs*Background: Black
     emacs*Foreground: White
     emacs*pointerColor: White
     emacs*cursorColor: White
     emacs*bitmapIcon: on
     emacs*font: fixed
     emacs*geometry: 80x40
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In general I favor dark backgrounds and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fixed</span></samp>&rsquo; fonts. Dark backgrounds
make it easier to sit in front of the monitor for a prolonged period of
time. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fixed</span></samp>&rsquo; fonts looks nice and it's small enough to make efficient
use of your screenspace. Some people might prefer larger fonts however.

   <p>When Emacs starts up, it looks for a file called <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> at the user's
home directory, and evaluates it's contents through the Emacs Lisp
interpreter. You can customize and modify Emacs' behaviour by
adding commands, written in Emacs Lisp, to this file. Here's a brief
outline of the ways in which you can customize Emacs:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>A common change to the standard configuration is
assigning <dfn>global variables</dfn> to non-default
values. Many Emacs features and behaviours can be controlled and
customized this way. 
This is done with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">setq</span></samp>&rsquo; command, which accepts the
following syntax:
     <pre class="example">          (setq <var>variable</var> <var>value</var>)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">For example:
     <pre class="example">          (setq viper-mode t)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">You can access on-line documentation for global variables by running:
     <pre class="example">          M-x describe-variable
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"><li>In some cases, Emacs depends on the values of shell
<dfn>environment variables</dfn>. These can be manipulated with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">setenv</span></samp>&rsquo;:
     <pre class="example">          (setenv "<var>variable</var>" "<var>value</var>")
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">For example:
     <pre class="example">          (setenv "INFOPATH" "/usr/info:/usr/local/info")
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">setenv</span></samp>&rsquo; does not affect the shell that invoked Emacs, but it does
affect Emacs itself, and shells that are run under Emacs.

     <li>Another way to enhance your Emacs configuration is by modifying the
global keymap. This can be done with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">global-set-key</span></samp>&rsquo; command,
which follows the following syntax:
     <pre class="example">          (global-set-key [<var>key sequence</var>] '<var>function</var>)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">For example, adding:
     <pre class="example">          (global-set-key [F12 d] 'doctor)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">to <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> makes the key sequence <kbd>F12 d</kbd> equivalent to
running &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M-x doctor</span></samp>&rsquo;. Emacs has many functions that provide all
sorts of features. To find out about specific functions, consult
the <cite>Emacs user manual</cite>. Once you know that a function exists,
you can also get on-line documentation for it by running:
     <pre class="example">          M-x describe-function
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">You can also write your own functions in Emacs Lisp.

     <li>It is not always good to introduce bindings to the global map. Any bindings
that are useful only within a certain mode should be added only to the local
keymap of that mode. Consider for example the following Emacs Lisp function:
     <pre class="example">          (defun texi-insert-@example ()
            "Insert an @example @end example block"
            (interactive)
            (beginning-of-line)
            (insert "\n@example\n")
            (save-excursion
              (insert "\n")
              (insert "@end example\n")
              (insert "\n@noindent\n")))
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">We would like to bind this function to the key &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F9</span></samp>&rsquo;, however we
would like this binding to be in effect only when we are within
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">texinfo-mode</span></samp>&rsquo;. To do that, first we must define a hook function
that establishes the local bindings using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">define-key</span></samp>&rsquo;:
     <pre class="example">          (defun texinfo-elef-hook ()
            (define-key texinfo-mode-map [F9] 'texi-insert-@example))
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">The syntax of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">define-key</span></samp>&rsquo; is similar to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">global-set-key</span></samp>&rsquo;
except it takes the name of the local keymap as an additional
argument. The local keymap of any &lsquo;<samp><var>name</var><span class="samp">-mode</span></samp>&rsquo; is
&lsquo;<samp><var>name</var><span class="samp">-mode-map</span></samp>&rsquo;. Finally, we must ask &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">texinfo-mode</span></samp>&rsquo;
to call the function &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">texinfo-elef-hook</span></samp>&rsquo;. To do that use the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">add-hook</span></samp>&rsquo; command:
     <pre class="example">          (add-hook 'texinfo-mode-hook 'texinfo-elef-hook)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">In some cases, Emacs itself will provide you with a few optional hooks
that you can attach to your modes.

     <li>You can write your own modes! If you write a program whose use involves
editing some type of input files, it is very much appreciated by the
community if you also write an Emacs mode for thet file and distribute
it with your program.
        </ol>

   <p>With the exception of simple customizations, most of the more complicated
ones require that you write new Emacs Lisp functions, distribute them
with your software and somehow make them visible to the installer's
Emacs when person installs your software. 
See <a href="Emacs-Lisp-with-Automake.html#Emacs-Lisp-with-Automake">Emacs Lisp with Automake</a>, for more details on how to include
Emacs Lisp packages to your software.

   <p>Here are some simple customizations that you might want to add to your
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file:

     <ul>
<li>Set your default background and foreground color for all your Emacs frames:
     <pre class="example">          (set-background-color "black")
          (set-foreground-color "white")
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">You can change the colors to your liking. 
<li>Tell Emacs your name and your email address. This is particularly useful
when you work on an off-line home system but you want Emacs to use the email
address of your internet provider, and your real name. Specifying your real
name is necessary if you call yourself &ldquo;Skeletor&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dude&rdquo; on your
home computer.
     <pre class="example">          (setq user-mail-address "karl@whitehouse.com")
          (setq user-full-name "President Karl Marx")
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Make sure the name is your real name, and the email address that you
include can receive email 24 hours per day. 
<li>Add a few toys to the status bar. These commands tell Emacs to display a
clock, and the line and column number of your cursor's position at all times.
     <pre class="example">          (display-time)
          (line-number-mode 1)
          (column-number-mode 1)
</pre>
     <li>When you use the mouse to cut and paste text with Emacs, mouse button 1
will select text and mouse button 2 will paste it. Unfortunately,
when you click mouse button 2, emacs will first move the cursor at the
location of the mouse, and then insert the text in that location. 
If you are used to editing with vi under xterms, you will instead prefer
to position the cursor yourself, and use mouse button 2 to simply cause
the text to be pasted without changing the position of the cursor. If you
prefer this behaviour, then add the following line to your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>:
     <pre class="example">          (global-set-key [mouse-2] 'yank)
</pre>
     <p>By default, selected text in Emacs buffers is highlighted with blue color. 
However, you can also select and paste into an Emacs buffer text that
you select from other applications, like your web browser, or your xterm. 
<li>Use <dfn>font-lock</dfn>. Font-lock decorates your editted text with colors that
make it easier to read text with complicated syntax, such as software
source codes. This is one of the coolest features of Emacs. To use it, add
the following lines to your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>:
     <pre class="example">          (global-font-lock-mode t)
          (setq font-lock-maximum-size nil)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"><li>To get rid of the scrollbar at the left of your Emacs window, type
     <pre class="example">          (setq scroll-bar-mode nil)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">The only reason that the scrollbar is default is to make Emacs more similar
to what lusers are used to. It is assumed that seasoned hacker, who will
be glad to see the scrollbar bite it, will figure out how to make it go away. 
<li>With most versions of Emacs, you should add the following to your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>
to make sure that editing <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp> takes you to <code>m4-mode</code>
and editing <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> takes you to <code>makefile-mode</code>.
     <pre class="example">          (setq auto-mode-alist
            (append '(
              ("configure.in" . m4-mode)
              ("\\.m4\\'" . m4-mode)
              ("\\.am\\'" . makefile-mode))
             auto-mode-alist))
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">You will have to edit such files if you use the GNU build system. 
See <a href="The-GNU-build-system.html#The-GNU-build-system">The GNU build system</a>, for more details. 
<li>If you have installed Emacs packages in non-standard directories,
you need to add them to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">load-path</span></samp>&rsquo; variable. For example,
here's how to add a couple of directories:
     <pre class="example">          (setq load-path
                (append "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp"
                        "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-site"
                        (expand-file-name "~lf/lisp")
                        load-path))
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Note the use of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">expand-file-name</span></samp>&rsquo; for dealing with non-absolute
directories. If you are a user in an account where you don't have root
priviledge, you are very likely to need to install your Emacs packages
in a non-standard directory. 
<li>See <a href="Using-vi-emulation.html#Using-vi-emulation">Using vi emulation</a>, if you would like to customize Emacs to run
a vi editor under the Emacs system. 
<li>See <a href="Navigating-source-code.html#Navigating-source-code">Navigating source code</a>, for more details on how to customize Emacs to
make navigating a source code directory tree easier. 
<li>See <a href="Using-Emacs-as-an-email-client.html#Using-Emacs-as-an-email-client">Using Emacs as an email client</a>, if you would like to set up Emacs to
process your email. 
<li>Autotools distributes two Emacs packages. One for handling copyright notices,
and another one for handling Texinfo documentation. 
See <a href="Inserting-copyright-notices-with-Emacs.html#Inserting-copyright-notices-with-Emacs">Inserting copyright notices with Emacs</a>, and
See <a href="GNU-Emacs-support-for-Texinfo.html#GNU-Emacs-support-for-Texinfo">GNU Emacs support for Texinfo</a>, for more details. 
</ul>
   Emacs now has a graphical user interface to customization that will
write <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> for you automatically. To use it, select:
<pre class="example">     Help ==&gt; Customize ==&gt; Browse Customization Groups
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">from the menu bar. You can also manipulate some common settings from:
<pre class="example">     Help ==&gt; Options
</pre>
