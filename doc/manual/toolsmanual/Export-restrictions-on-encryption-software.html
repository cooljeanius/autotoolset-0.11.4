<h3 class="section">A.3 Export restrictions on encryption software</h3>

<p>An additional legal burden to both copyrights and patents is governmental
boneheadedness over encryption algorithms. According to the US government,
a computer program implementing an encryption algorithm is considered
munition, therefore export-control laws on munitions apply. What is
not allowed under these laws is to export the software outside the
borders of the US. The government is pushing the issue by claiming that
making encryption software available on the internet is the same thing
as exporting it. Zimmermann, the author of a popular encryption program,
was sued by the government based on this interpretation of the law. 
However the government's position was not tested at court because the
government decided to drop the charges, after dragging the case for a few
years, long enough to send a message of terror to the internet community. 
The current wisdom seems to be
that it is okey to make encryption software available on the net provided
that you take strong measures that will prevent foreigners to download your
work. It should be noted however that doing so still <em>is</em> taking
a legal risk that could land you to federal prison in the company of
international smugglers of TOW missiles and M1 Abrams tanks.

   <p>The reason why the government's attitude towards encryption is
unconstitutional is because it violates our inalienable right to freedom
of speech. It is the current policy of the government that publishing
a book containing the source code for encryption software is legal, but
publishing the exact same content in digital form is illegal. As the
internet increasingly becomes the library of the future, part of our
freedom will be lost. The reason why the government maintains such
a strange position today is because in the past they have tried to
assert that publishing encryption software <em>both</em> digitally and on
books is illegal. When the RSA algorithm was discovered, the National
Security Agency (also known as NSA &ndash; No Such Agency)
attempted to prevent the inventors from publishing their discovery in
journals and presenting it at conferences. Judges understand books and
conferences and the government had to give up fighting that battle. They
still haven't given up on the electronic front however.

   <p>Other countries also have restrictive laws against encryption. In certain
places, like France,  you are not be even allowed to run such programs. 
<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
The
reason why governments are so paranoid of encryption is because it is the key
to a wide array of technologies that have the potential to empower the
individual citizens to an extent that makes governments uncomfortable. 
Encryption is routinely used now by human rights activists operating on
totalitarian countries. Encryption can also be used to create an
unsanctioned para-economy based on digital cash, and allow individuals
to carry out transcations and contracts completely anonymously. 
These prospects are not good news for Big Brother.

   <p>The Free Software Foundation is fighting the US government export
restrictions very effectively by asking volunteers in a free country
to develop free encryption software. The GNU Privacy Guard is now very
stable, and is already being used by software developers.
