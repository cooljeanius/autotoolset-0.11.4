<h3 class="section">5.3 Installation standard directories</h3>

<p>Previously, we mentioned that the symbols &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bin</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lib</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">include</span></samp>&rsquo; refer to installation locations that are defined respectively
by the variables &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bindir</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libdir</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">includedir</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
For completeness, we will now list the installation locations available by
default by Automake and describe their purpose.

   <p>All installation locations are placed under one of the following directories:
     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">prefix</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The default value of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(prefix)</span></samp>&rsquo; is <samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp> and it is used
to construct installation locations for machine-indepedent files. The actual
value is specified at configure-time with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--prefix</span></samp>&rsquo; argument. 
For example:
     <pre class="example">          configure --prefix=/home/lf
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">exec_prefix</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The default value of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(exec_prefix)</span></samp>&rsquo; is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(prefix)</span></samp>&rsquo; and it
used to construct installation location for machine-dependent files. 
The actual value is specified at configure-time with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--exec-prefix</span></samp>&rsquo;
argument. For example:
     <pre class="example">          configure --prefix=/home/lf --exec-prefix=/home/lf/gnulinux
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">The purpose of using a seperate location for machine-dependent files
is because then it makes it possible to install the software
on a networked file server and make that available to
machines with different architectures. To do that there must be seperate
copies of all the machine-dependent files for each architecture in use. 
</dl>

   <p>The GNU coding standards describe in detail the standard directories
in which you should install your files. All of these standard locations
are supported by Automake. So, for example, you can write things like
<pre class="example">     sbin_PROGRAMS = <var>prog</var> ...
     sharedstate_DATA = <var>foo</var> ...
     ....
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">without having to define the variables &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sbindir</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sharedstatedir</span></samp>&rsquo;
and so on.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Program-related files are installed in one of the following locations:
          <dl>
<dt><code>bindir = $(exec_prefix)/bin</code><dd>The directory for installing executable programs that users can run. 
The default value for this directory is <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/bin</span></samp>. 
<br><dt><code>sbindir = $(exec_prefix)/sbin</code><dd>The directory for installing executable programs that can be run
from the shell, but are only generally useful to system administrators. 
The default value for this directory is <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/sbin</span></samp>. 
<br><dt><code>libexecdir = $(exec_prefix)/libexec</code><dd>The directory for installing executable programs to be run by other
programs rather than by users. The default value for this directory
is <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/libexec</span></samp>. 
<br><dt><code>libdir = $(exec_prefix)/lib</code><dd>The directory for installing libraries to be linked by other programs. 
The default value for this directory is <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/lib</span></samp>. 
Please don't use this directory to install data files. 
<br><dt><code>includedir = $(prefix)/include</code><dd>The directory for installing public header files that declare the
symbols of installed libraries. 
</dl>
     <li>Data files should be installed in one of the following directories:
          <dl>
<dt><code>datadir = $(prefix)/share</code><dd>The directory for installing read-only architecture independent data files. 
The default value for this directory is <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/share</span></samp>. 
Usually, most data files that you would like to install will have to
go under this directory. These files are part of the program implementation
and should not be modified. 
<br><dt><code>sysconfdir = $(prefix)/etc</code><dd>The directory for installing read-only data files that pertain to a
single machine's configuration. Even though applications should only
read, and not modify, these files, the user may have to modify these
files to configure the application. Examples of files that belong
in this directory are mailer and network configuration files, password
files and so on. Do not install files that are modified in the normal
course of their use (programs whose purpose is to change the configuration
of the system excluded). Those probably belond in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">localstatedir</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
<br><dt><code>sharedstatedir = $(prefix)/com</code><dd>The directory for installing architecture-independent data files which
the programs modify while they run. The default value for this
directory is <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/com</span></samp>. 
<br><dt><code>localstatedir = $(prefix)/var</code><dd>The directory for installing data files which the programs modify while
they run, and that pertain to one specific machine. Users should never
have to modify the files in this directory to configure the package's
operation. The default value for this directory is
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/var</span></samp>. System logs and mail spools are examples of
data files that belong in this directory. 
</dl>
     <li>Then there are some directories for developing various eccentric
types of files:
          <dl>
<dt><code>lispdir = $(datadir)/emacs/site-lisp</code><dd>The directory for installing Emacs Lisp files. The default value
of this directory is
          <pre class="example">               <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp</span></samp>.
</pre>
          <p class="noindent">This directory is not automatically defined by Automake. To define it,
you must invoke
          <pre class="example">               AM_PATH_LISPDIR
</pre>
          <p class="noindent">from Autoconf. See <a href="Emacs-Lisp-with-Automake.html#Emacs-Lisp-with-Automake">Emacs Lisp with Automake</a>. 
<br><dt><code>m4dir = $(datadir)/aclocal</code><dd>The directory for installing Autoconf macros. This directory is not
automatically defined by Automake so you will have to add a line
in <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp>:
          <pre class="example">               m4dir = $(datadir)/aclocal
</pre>
          <p class="noindent">to define it yourself. See <a href="Writing-Autoconf-macros.html#Writing-Autoconf-macros">Writing Autoconf macros</a>. 
</dl>
     <li>Documentation should be installed in the following directories:
          <dl>
<dt><code>infodir = $(prefix)/info</code><dd>The directory for installing the Info files for this package. 
The default value for this directory is <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/info</span></samp>. 
See <a href="Introduction-to-Texinfo.html#Introduction-to-Texinfo">Introduction to Texinfo</a>. 
<br><dt><code>mandir = $(prefix)/man</code><dd>The top-level directory for installing the man pages (if any) for this
package. The default value for this directory is <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/man</span></samp>. 
See <a href="Writing-man-pages.html#Writing-man-pages">Writing man pages</a>. 
<br><dt><code>man1dir = $(prefix)/man1</code><dd>The top-level directory for installing section 1 man pages. 
<br><dt><code>man2dir = $(prefix)/man2</code><dd>The top-level directory for installing section 2 man pages. 
</dl>
     </ol>
Automake also defines the following subdirectories for your convenience:
<pre class="example">     pkglibdir     = $(libdir)/@PACKAGE@
     pkgincludedir = $(includedir)/@PACKAGE@
     pkgdatadir    = $(datadir)/@PACKAGE@
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">These subdirectories are useful for segregating the files of your
package from other packages. Of these three, you are most likely to
want to use <code>pkgincludedir</code> to segragate public header files,
as we discussed in <a href="Dealing-with-header-files.html#Dealing-with-header-files">Dealing with header files</a>. For similar
reasons you might like to segregate your data files. 
The only reason for using <code>pkglibdir</code> is to
install dynamic libraries that are meant to be loaded only at run-time
while an application is running. 
You should not use a subdirectory for libraries that are linked to
programs, even dynamically, while the programs are being compiled, because
that will make it more difficult to compile your programs. However,
things like plug-ins, widget themes and so on should have their own
directory.
