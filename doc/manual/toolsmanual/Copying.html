<h2 class="unnumbered">Copying</h2>

<p>This book that you are now reading is actually free. The information
in it is freely available to anyone. The machine readable source code
for the book is freely distributed on the internet and anyone may take
this book and make as many copies as they like. (take a moment to
check the copying permissions on the Copyright page). If you paid money
for this book, what you actually paid for was the book's nice printing and
binding, and the publisher's associated costs to produce it.

   <p>The <em>GNU development tools</em> include Automake, Autoconf, Libtool,
Make, Emacs, Texinfo and the GNU C and C++ compilers. These programs
are &ldquo;free&rdquo;; this means that everyone is free to use them and
free to redistribute them on a free basis. These programs are not in the
public domain; they are copyrighted and there are restrictions on their
distribution, but these restrictions are designed to permit everything that
a good cooperating citizen would want to do. What is not allowed is to try
to prevent others from further sharing any version of these programs
that they might get from you.

   <p>Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away
copies of the programs and documents that relate to them, that you
receive source code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change
these programs or use pieces of them in new free programs, and that you
know you can do these things.

   <p>To make sure that everyone has such rights, we don't allow you to deprive
anyone else of these rights. For example, if you distribute copies of the
code related to the <em>GNU development tools</em>, you must give the recipients
all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, can get the
source code. And you must tell them their rights.

   <p>Also for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out that
there is no warranty for the programs that relate to the
<em>GNU development tools</em>. If these programs are modified by
someone else and passed on, we want their recipients to know that what
they have is not what we distributed, so that any problems introduced by
others will not reflect on our reputation.

   <p>The precise conditions of the licenses for the <em>GNU development tools</em>
are found in the General Public Licenses that accompany them.
