<h3 class="section">4.7 Organizing your project in subdirectories</h3>

<p>If your program is very small, you can place all your files in the
top-level directory, like we did in the Hello World example
(see <a href="Hello-world-example-with-Autoconf-and-Automake.html#Hello-world-example-with-Autoconf-and-Automake">Hello world example with Autoconf and Automake</a>). 
Such packages are called <dfn>shallow</dfn>.

   <p>In general, it is prefered to organize your package as a <dfn>deep package</dfn>. 
In a deep package, the documentation files
<pre class="example">     README, INSTALL, AUTHORS, THANKS, ChangeLog, COPYING
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">as well as the build cruft are placed at the top-level directory, and
the rest of the files are placed in subdirectories. It is standard
practice to use the following subdirectories:
     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">src</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The actual source code that gets compiled. Every library
should have it's own subdirectory. Executables should get their own
directory as well. If each executable corresponds only to one or two files
then it is sensible to put them all under the same directory. If your
executables need more source files, or they can be seperated in distinct
classes of functionalities you may like to regroup them under multiple
directories. Feel free to use your judgement on how to do this best. 
It is easiest to place the library test suites on the same directory with
the library source code. If that does not sit well with you however, you
should put the test suite for each library in subdirectories <em>under</em> that
library's directory. It is a massively bad idea to put the test suites
for different libraries under the same directory. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lib</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>An optional directory where you put portability-related source code. 
This is mainly replacement implementation for system calls that
are unavailable on some systems. You can also put tools here that you commonly
use accross many different packages, tools that are too simple to just
make libraries out of every one of them. Common files encountered here
are files that replace system calls to the GNU C library that are not
available in proprietary C libraries. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">doc</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A directory containing the documentation for your package. 
You have the creative freedom to present the documentation in any way that is
effective. However
the prefered way to document software is by using Texinfo. Texinfo has the
advantage that you can produce both on-line help as well as nice printed
books from the same source. Documentation is discussed in more detail
in See <a href="Maintaining-Documentation.html#Maintaining-Documentation">Maintaining Documentation</a>. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m4</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A directory containing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m4</span></samp>&rsquo; files that you package may need to
<em>install</em>. 
These files define new &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">autoconf</span></samp>&rsquo; macros that you
should make available to other developers who want to use your libraries. 
This is discussed in more detail in <strong>FIXME: crossreference</strong>. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">intl</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A directory containing boilerplate portability source code that allows
your program to speak in many human languages. The contents of this
directory are automatically maintained by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gettext</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
(<strong>FIXME: crossreference</strong>)
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">po</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A directory containing message catalogs for your software package. 
This is where the maintainer places the translations of per software
in multiple human languages. 
(<strong>FIXME: crossreference</strong>)
</dl>
   Automake makes it very easy to maintain multidirectory source code
packages, so you shouldn't shy away from taking advantage of it. 
Multidirectory packages are more convenient for most projects.
