<h3 class="section">3.2 Programs with many source files</h3>

<p>Now let's consider the case where you have a much larger program made
of source files <samp><span class="file">foo1.c</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">foo2.c</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">foo3.c</span></samp> and
header files <samp><span class="file">header1.h</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">header2.h</span></samp>. 
One way to compile the program is like this:
<pre class="example">     % gcc foo1.c foo2.c foo3.c -o foo
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This is fine when you have only a few files to deal with. Eventually,
when you have more than a few dozen files, it becomes wasteful to
compile all of the files, all the time, every time you make a change
in only one of the files. For this reason, the compiler allows
you to compile every file separately into an intermediate file
called <dfn>object file</dfn>, and link all the object files together at the end. 
This can be done with the following commands:
<pre class="example">     % gcc -c foo1.c
     % gcc -c foo2.c
     % gcc -c foo3.c
     % gcc foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o -o foo
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first three commands generate the object files <samp><span class="file">foo1.o</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">foo2.o</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">foo3.o</span></samp> and the last command links them together
to the final executable file <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp>. The <samp><span class="file">*.o</span></samp> suffix is reserved
for use only by object files.

   <p>If you make a change only in
<samp><span class="file">foo1.c</span></samp>, then you can rebuild <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> like this:
<pre class="example">     % gcc -c foo1.c
     % gcc foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o -o foo
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The object files <samp><span class="file">foo2.o</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">foo3.o</span></samp> do not need to be
rebuilt since only <samp><span class="file">foo1.c</span></samp> changed, so it is not necessary to
recompile them.

   <p>Object files <samp><span class="file">*.o</span></samp> contain definitions of variables
and subroutines written out in <dfn>assembly</dfn>
(machine language &ldquo;pseudocode&rdquo;). Most of
these definitions will eventually be embedded in the final executable
program at a specific address. At this stage however these memory addresses
are not known so they are being refered to symbolically. These
symbolic references are called <dfn>symbols</dfn>. It is possible to list
the symbols defined in an object file with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nm</span></samp>&rsquo; command. 
For example:
<pre class="example">     % nm xmalloc.o
              U error
              U malloc
              U realloc
     00000000 D xalloc_exit_failure
     00000000 t xalloc_fail
     00000004 D xalloc_fail_func
     00000014 R xalloc_msg_memory_exhausted
     00000030 T xmalloc
     00000060 T xrealloc
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first column lists the symbol's address within the object file, when
the symbol is actually defined in that object file. 
The second column lists the symbol type. The third column is the symbolic
name of the symbol. In the final executable, these names become
irrelevant. 
The following types commonly occur:
     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">T</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A function definition
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A private function definition. Such functions are defined in C with
the keyword <code>static</code>. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">D</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A global variable
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A read-only (<code>const</code>) global variable
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">U</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A symbol used but not defined in this object file. 
</dl>
   For more details, see the <cite>Binutils manual</cite>.

   <p>The job of the compiler is to translate all the C source files to
object files containing a corresponding set of symbolic definitions. 
It is the job of another program, the <dfn>linker</dfn>, to put the object files
together, resolve and evaluate all the symbolic addresses, and build
a complete machine language program that can actually be executed. 
When you ask &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gcc</span></samp>&rsquo; to link the object files into an executable, the
compiler is actually running the linker to do the job.

   <p>During the process of linking, all the machine language instructions that
refer to a specific memory address need to be modified to use the correct
addresses within the executable, as oppposed to the addresses within their
object file. This becomes an issue when you want to your program to load
and link compiled object files during run-time instead of compile-time. 
To make such <dfn>dynamic linking</dfn> possible, your symbols need to be
<dfn>relocatable</dfn>. This means that your symbols definitions must be
correct no matter where you place them in memory. There should be no
memory addresses that need to be modified. One way to do this is by
refering to memory addresses within the object file by giving an offset
from the refering address. Memory addresses outside the object file must
be treated as <dfn>interlibrary dependencies</dfn> and you must tell the compiler
what you expect them to be when you attempt to build relocatable machine code. 
Unfortunately some flavours of Unix do not handle interlibrary dependencies
correctly. Fortunately, all of this mess can be dealt with in a uniform
way, to the extent that this is possible, by using GNU Libtool. 
See <a href="Using-Libtool.html#Using-Libtool">Using Libtool</a>, for more details.

   <p>On GNU and Unix, all compiled languages compile to object files,
and it is possible, in principle, to link object files that have originated
from source files written in different programming languages. For example
it is possible to link source code written in Fortran together with
source code written in C or C++. In such cases, you need to know how the
compiler converts the names with which the program language calls its
constructs (such as variable, subroutines, etc.) to symbol names. 
Such conversions, when they actually happen, are called
<dfn>name-mangling</dfn>. Both C++ and Fortran do name-mangling. C however is
a very nice language, because it does absolutely no name-mangling. 
This is why when you want to write code that you want to export to
many programming languages, it is best to write it in C. 
See <a href="Using-Fortran-effectively.html#Using-Fortran-effectively">Using Fortran effectively</a>, for more details on how to deal with
the name-mangling done by Fortran compilers.
