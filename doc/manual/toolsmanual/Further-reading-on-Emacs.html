<h3 class="section">2.10 Further reading on Emacs</h3>

<p>This chapter should be enough to get you going with GNU Emacs. This is
really all you need to know to use Emacs to develop software. However,
the more you learn about Emacs, the more effectively you will be able to use
it, and there is still a lot to learn; a lot more than we can fit in this
one chapter. In this section we refer to other manuals that you can read
to learn more about Emacs. Unlike many proprietary manuals that you are
likely to find in bookstores, these manuals are <em>free</em>
(see <a href="Why-free-software-needs-free-documentation.html#Why-free-software-needs-free-documentation">Why free software needs free documentation</a>). 
Whenever possible, please contribute to the GNU project by ordering
a bound copy of the free documentation from the Free Software Foundation, or
by contributing a donation.

   <p>The Free Software Foundation publishes the following manuals on Emacs:
     <dl>
<dt><cite>The Emacs Editor</cite><dd>This manual tells you all there is to know about all the spiffy
things that Emacs can do, except for a few things here and there that
are so spiffy that they get to have their own separate manual. The printed
version, published by the Free Software Foundation, features our hero,
Richard Stallman, riding a gnu. It also includes the GNU Manifesto. 
The machine readable source for the manual is distributed with GNU Emacs. 
<br><dt><cite>Programming in Emacs Lisp</cite><dd>A wonderful introduction to Emacs Lisp, written by Robert Chassell. 
If you want to learn programming in Emacs Lisp, start by reading this manual. 
You can order this manual as a bound book from the Free Software Foundation. 
You can also download a machine readable copy of the manual from any
GNU ftp site. Look for <samp><span class="file">elisp-manual-20-2.5.tar.gz</span></samp>. 
<br><dt><cite>The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite><dd>This is a comprehensive reference manual for the Emacs Lisp language. 
You can also order this manual as a bound book from the Free Software
Foundation. 
You can also download a machine readable copy of the manual from any
GNU ftp site. Look for <samp><span class="file">emacs-lisp-intro-1.05.tar.gz</span></samp>. 
</dl>
   The following manuals are also distributed with the GNU Emacs source code
and they make for some very fun reading:
     <dl>
<dt><cite>Gnus Manual</cite><dd>Gnus is the Emacs newsreader. You can also use it to sort out your email,
especially if you are subscribed to twenty mailing lists and receive
tons of email every day. This manual will tell you all you need to know
about Gnus to use it effectively. (<samp><span class="file">gnus.dvi</span></samp>)
<br><dt><cite>CC Mode</cite><dd>The Emacs C editing mode will help you write C code that is beautifully
formatted and consistent with the GNU coding standards. If you develop
software for an organization that follows different coding standards,
you will have to customize Emacs to use their standards instead. If they
are lame and haven't given you Elisp code for their standards, then this
manual will show you how to roll your own. (<samp><span class="file">cc-mode.dvi</span></samp>)
<br><dt><cite>Common Lisp Extensions</cite><dd>Emacs has a package that introduces many Common Lisp extensions to Emacs Lisp. 
This manual describes what extensions are available and how to use them. 
(<samp><span class="file">cl.dvi</span></samp>)
<br><dt><cite>Writing Customization Definitions</cite><dd>Recent versions of Emacs have an elaborate user-friendly customization
interface that will let users customize Emacs and update their
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> files automatically for them. If you are writing large
Emacs packages, it is very easy to add a customization interface to them. 
This manual explains how to do it. 
(<samp><span class="file">customize.dvi</span></samp>)
<br><dt><cite>The Emacs Widget Library</cite><dd>It is possible to insert actual widgets in an Emacs buffer that are
bound to Emacs Lisp functions. This feature of Emacs is used, for example,
in the newly introduced customization interface. This manual documents
the Elisp API for using these widgets in your own Elisp packages. 
(<samp><span class="file">widget.dvi</span></samp>)
<br><dt><cite>RefTeX User Manual</cite><dd>If you are writing large documents with LaTeX that contain a lot of
crossreferences, then the RefTeX package will make your life easier. 
(<samp><span class="file">reftex.dvi</span></samp>)
<br><dt><cite>Ediff User's Manual</cite><dd>Ediff is a comprehensive package for dealing with patches under Emacs. 
If you receive a lot of patches to your software projects from contributors,
you can use Ediff to apply them to your source code. 
(<samp><span class="file">ediff.dvi</span></samp>)
<br><dt><cite>Supercite User's Manual</cite><dd>If you think that quoting your responses to email messages with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; is for lamers and you want to be elite, then use Supercite. 
(<samp><span class="file">sc.dvi</span></samp>)
<br><dt><cite>Viper Is a Package for Emacs Rebels</cite><dd>This manual has more than you will ever need to know about Viper, the
Emacs vi emulation. <a href="Using-vi-emulation.html#Using-vi-emulation">Using vi emulation</a>, actually describes all
the features of Viper that you will ever really need. But still, it's
a good reading for a long airplane trip. 
(<samp><span class="file">viper.dvi</span></samp>)
