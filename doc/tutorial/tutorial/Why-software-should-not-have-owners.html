<h3 class="section">B.1 Why software should not have owners</h3>

<p>Digital information technology contributes to the world by
making it easier to copy and modify information. Computers
promise to make this easier for all of us.

   <p>Not everyone wants it to be easier. The system of copyright
gives software programs &ldquo;owners&rdquo;, most of whom aim to
withhold software's potential benefit from the rest of the public. 
They would like to be the only ones who can copy and modify the
software that we use.

   <p>The copyright system grew up with printing&mdash;a technology for
mass production copying. Copyright fit in well with this
technology because it restricted only the mass producers of
copies. It did not take freedom away from readers of books. An
ordinary reader, who did not own a printing press, could copy
books only with pen and ink, and few readers were sued for that.

   <p>Digital technology is more flexible than the printing press: when
information has digital form, you can easily copy it to share it
with others. This very flexibility makes a bad fit with a system
like copyright. That's the reason for the increasingly nasty and
draconian measures now used to enforce software copyright. 
Consider these four practices of the Software Publishers
Association (SPA):

     <ul>
<li>Massive propaganda saying it is wrong to disobey the
owners to help your friend. 
<li>Solicitation for stool pigeons to inform on their
coworkers and colleagues. 
<li>Raids (with police help) on offices and schools, in which
people are told they must prove they are innocent of
illegal copying. 
<li>Prosecution (by the US government, at the SPA's
request) of people such as MIT's David LaMacchia, not
for copying software (he is not accused of copying any),
but merely for leaving copying facilities unguarded and
failing to censor their use. 
</ul>

   <p>All four practices resemble those used in the former Soviet
Union, where every copying machine had a guard to prevent
forbidden copying, and where individuals had to copy information
secretly and pass it from hand to hand as &ldquo;samizdat&rdquo;. There is
of course a difference: the motive for information control in the
Soviet Union was political; in the US the motive is profit. But it
is the actions that affect us, not the motive. Any attempt to
block the sharing of information, no matter why, leads to the
same methods and the same harshness.

   <p>Owners make several kinds of arguments for giving them the
power to control how we use information:
     <ul>
<li><strong>Name calling</strong>:
Owners use smear words such as &ldquo;piracy&rdquo; and
&ldquo;theft&rdquo;, as well as expert terminology such as
&ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; and &ldquo;damage&rdquo;, to suggest a
certain line of thinking to the public&mdash;a simplistic
analogy between programs and physical objects.

     <p>Our ideas and intuitions about property for material
objects are about whether it is right to <em>take an object away</em>
from someone else. They don't directly apply to
<em>making a copy</em> of something. But the owners ask us to
apply them anyway. 
<li><strong>Exaggeration</strong>:
Owners say that they suffer &ldquo;harm&rdquo; or &ldquo;economic
loss&rdquo; when users copy programs themselves. But the
copying has no direct effect on the owner, and it harms
no one. The owner can lose only if the person who made
the copy would otherwise have paid for one from the
owner.

     <p>A little thought shows that most such people would not
have bought copies. Yet the owners compute their
&ldquo;losses&rdquo; as if each and every one would have bought a
copy. That is exaggeration&mdash;to put it kindly. 
<li><strong>The law</strong>:
Owners often describe the current state of the law, and
the harsh penalties they can threaten us with. Implicit in
this approach is the suggestion that today's law reflects
an unquestionable view of morality&mdash;yet at the same
time, we are urged to regard these penalties as facts of
nature that can't be blamed on anyone.

     <p>This line of persuasion isn't designed to stand up to
critical thinking; it's intended to reinforce a habitual
mental pathway.

     <p>It's elementary that laws don't decide right and wrong. 
Every American should know that, forty years ago, it
was against the law in many states for a black person to
sit in the front of a bus; but only racists would say
sitting there was wrong. 
<li><strong>Natural rights</strong>:
Authors often claim a special connection with programs
they have written, and go on to assert that, as a result,
their desires and interests concerning the program
simply outweigh those of anyone else&mdash;or even those
of the whole rest of the world. (Typically companies, not
authors, hold the copyrights on software, but we are
expected to ignore this discrepancy.)

     <p>To those who propose this as an ethical axiom&mdash;the
author is more important than you&mdash;I can only say that
I, a notable software author myself, call it bunk.

     <p>But people in general are only likely to feel any
sympathy with the natural rights claims for two reasons.

     <p>One reason is an overstretched analogy with material
objects. When I cook spaghetti, I do object if someone
else eats it, because then I cannot eat it. His action
hurts me exactly as much as it benefits him; only one of
us can eat the spaghetti, so the question is, which? The
smallest distinction between us is enough to tip the
ethical balance.

     <p>But whether you run or change a program I wrote affects
you directly and me only indirectly. Whether you give a
copy to your friend affects you and your friend much
more than it affects me. I shouldn't have the power to
tell you not to do these things. No one should.

     <p>The second reason is that people have been told that
natural rights for authors is the accepted and
unquestioned tradition of our society.

     <p>As a matter of history, the opposite is true. The idea of
natural rights of authors was proposed and decisively
rejected when the US Constitution was drawn up. That's
why the Constitution only permits a system of copyright
and does not require one; that's why it says that
copyright must be temporary. It also states that the
purpose of copyright is to promote progress&mdash;not to
reward authors. Copyright does reward authors
somewhat, and publishers more, but that is intended as a
means of modifying their behavior.

     <p>The real established tradition of our society is that
copyright cuts into the natural rights of the
public&mdash;and that this can only be justified for the
public's sake. 
<li><strong>Economics</strong>
The final argument made for having owners of software
is that this leads to production of more software.

     <p>Unlike the others, this argument at least takes a
legitimate approach to the subject. It is based on a valid
goal&mdash;satisfying the users of software. And it is
empirically clear that people will produce more of
something if they are well paid for doing so.

     <p>But the economic argument has a flaw: it is based on the
assumption that the difference is only a matter of how
much money we have to pay. It assumes that
&ldquo;production of software&rdquo; is what we want, whether the
software has owners or not.

     <p>People readily accept this assumption because it
accords with our experiences with material objects. 
Consider a sandwich, for instance. You might well be
able to get an equivalent sandwich either free or for a
price. If so, the amount you pay is the only difference. 
Whether or not you have to buy it, the sandwich has the
same taste, the same nutritional value, and in either
case you can only eat it once. Whether you get the
sandwich from an owner or not cannot directly affect
anything but the amount of money you have afterwards.

     <p>This is true for any kind of material object&mdash;whether or
not it has an owner does not directly affect what it is, or
what you can do with it if you acquire it.

     <p>But if a program has an owner, this very much affects
what it is, and what you can do with a copy if you buy
one. The difference is not just a matter of money. The
system of owners of software encourages software
owners to produce something&mdash;but not what society
really needs. And it causes intangible ethical pollution
that affects us all.

     <p>What does society need? It needs information that is
truly available to its citizens&mdash;for example, programs
that people can read, fix, adapt, and improve, not just
operate. But what software owners typically deliver is a
black box that we can't study or change.

     <p>Society also needs freedom. When a program has an
owner, the users lose freedom to control part of their
own lives.

     <p>And above all society needs to encourage the spirit of
voluntary cooperation in its citizens. When software
owners tell us that helping our neighbors in a natural
way is &ldquo;piracy&rdquo;, they pollute our society's civic spirit.

     <p>This is why we say that free software is a matter of
freedom, not price.

     <p>The economic argument for owners is erroneous, but the
economic issue is real. Some people write useful
software for the pleasure of writing it or for admiration
and love; but if we want more software than those
people write, we need to raise funds.

     <p>For ten years now, free software developers have tried
various methods of finding funds, with some success. 
There's no need to make anyone rich; the median US
family income, around $35k, proves to be enough
incentive for many jobs that are less satisfying than
programming.

     <p>For years, until a fellowship made it unnecessary, I
made a living from custom enhancements of the free
software I had written. Each enhancement was added to
the standard released version and thus eventually
became available to the general public. Clients paid me
so that I would work on the enhancements they wanted,
rather than on the features I would otherwise have
considered highest priority.

     <p>The Free Software Foundation (FSF), a tax-exempt
charity for free software development, raises funds by
selling GNU CD-ROMs, T-shirts, manuals, and deluxe
distributions, (all of which users are free to copy and
change), as well as from donations. It now has a staff of
five programmers, plus three employees who handle mail
orders.

     <p>Some free software developers make money by selling
support services. Cygnus Support, with around 50
employees [when this article was written], estimates
that about 15 per cent of its staff activity is free
software development&mdash;a respectable percentage for a
software company.

     <p>Companies including Intel, Motorola, Texas Instruments
and Analog Devices have combined to fund the
continued development of the free GNU compiler for the
language C. Meanwhile, the GNU compiler for the Ada
language is being funded by the US Air Force, which
believes this is the most cost-effective way to get a
high quality compiler. [Air Force funding ended some
time ago; the GNU Ada Compiler is now in service, and
its maintenance is funded commercially.]

     <p>All these examples are small; the free software
movement is still small, and still young. But the example
of listener-supported radio in this country [the US]
shows it's possible to support a large activity without
forcing each user to pay. 
</ul>

   <p>As a computer user today, you may find yourself using a
proprietary program. If your friend asks to
make a copy, it would be wrong to refuse. Cooperation is more
important than copyright. But underground, closet cooperation
does not make for a good society. A person should aspire to live
an upright life openly with pride, and this means saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to
proprietary software.

   <p>You deserve to be able to cooperate openly and freely with other
people who use software. You deserve to be able to learn how
the software works, and to teach your students with it. You
deserve to be able to hire your favorite programmer to fix it when
it breaks.

   <p>You deserve free software.
