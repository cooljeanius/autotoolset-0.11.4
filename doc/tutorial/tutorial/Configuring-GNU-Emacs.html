<h3 class="section">3.3 Configuring GNU Emacs</h3>

<p>To use Emacs effectively for software development you need to configure it. 
Part of the configuration needs to be done in your X-resources file. 
On a Debian GNU/Linux system, the X-resources can be configured by editing
<pre class="example">     /etc/X11/Xresources
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In many systems, you can configure X-resources by editing a file called
<samp><span class="file">.Xresources</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">.Xdefaults</span></samp> on your home directory, but
that is system-dependent. The configuration that I use on my system
is:
<pre class="example">     ! Emacs defaults
     emacs*Background: Black
     emacs*Foreground: White
     emacs*pointerColor: White
     emacs*cursorColor: White
     emacs*bitmapIcon: on
     emacs*font: fixed
     emacs*geometry: 80x40
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In general I favor dark backgrounds and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fixed</span></samp>&rsquo; fonts. Dark backgrounds
make it easier to sit in front of the monitor for a prolonged period of
time. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fixed</span></samp>&rsquo; fonts looks nice and it's small enough to make efficient
use of your screenspace. Some people might prefer larger fonts however.

   <p>The bulk of Emacs configuration is done by editing or creating an
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file
in your home directory. If you feel comfortable editing this file with the
unconfigured Emacs editor, go for it. Alternatively, you can use the vanilla
vi editor. (see <a href="Using-vi-emulation.html#Using-vi-emulation">Using vi emulation</a>). Here are some things that you
might want to add to your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file:
     <ul>
<li>You can override your X-default background and foreground color in your
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file. For the sake of redundancy, if nothing else,
add the following lines to your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>:
     <pre class="example">          (set-background-color "black")
          (set-foreground-color "white")
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">You can change the colors to your liking. 
<li>In many circumstances, Emacs needs to know your name and email address. 
For example, when you update a <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>, Emacs needs to know
these two pieces of information to create a time-stamp. This information
is also needed when you use Emacs to browse the newsgroups or send email. 
Usually, Emacs can guess this information from your password file and
if it can deduce your hostname and domain-name it can put together an
email address. Home systems, that connect to the internet over modem,
may not have a valid email address, and since we have root on these
systems, we like to call ourselves things like &ldquo;Skeletor&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dude&rdquo;,
when people finger us, but not on our <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> files or in our
emails to our boss. To give Emacs your official name and email address,
add the following two lines in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file:
     <pre class="example">          (setq user-mail-address "dude@whitehouse.com")
          (setq user-full-name "Karl Marx")
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Make sure the name is your real name, and the email address that you
include can receive email 24 hours per day. 
<li>You can tell Emacs to display a little clock on each frame by adding
the following line in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>:
     <pre class="example">          (display-time)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">You can also tell Emacs to show you the line and column number of your
cursor's position at all times by adding the following lines in your
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>
     <pre class="example">          (line-number-mode 1)
          (column-number-mode 1)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">All of these features can be very convenient. 
<li>To cut and paste text from frame to frame, you can use the mouse. 
Mouse button 1 will select text and mouse button 2 will paste the text. 
Unfortunately, when you click mouse button 2, emacs will first move the
cursor at the location of the mouse, and insert the text in that location. 
If you are used to editing with vi under xterms, you won't like this behaviour. 
Instead, you will prefer to position the cursor yourself, and you will
want mouse button 2 to simply cause the text to be pasted without
changing the position of the cursor. If you prefer this behaviour,
add the following line to your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>:
     <pre class="example">          (global-set-key [mouse-2] 'yank)
</pre>
     <p>By default, selected text in Emacs buffers is highlighted with blue color. 
However, you can also select and paste into an Emacs buffer text that
you select from other applications, like your web browser, or your xterm. 
<li>You may like to use <dfn>font-lock</dfn>. 
Emacs understands to a great extent the syntax of your text, especially when
your text is source code, and it can mark differents parts of your text
with different colors depending on what the text means syntactically. 
For example, with C source code, comments are marked red, stuff in quotes
are marked brown and certain keywords are marked green, blue, etc. 
To activate font-lock, add the following lines to your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>:
     <pre class="example">          (global-font-lock-mode t)
          (setq font-lock-maximum-size nil)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">At first, fontlock might appear disconcerting to you. It only takes about
a day to get used to it, and then you won't be able to do without it. 
Not only does font-lock make your text look prettier. It can also help you
catch common mistakes like run-away C comments, stray quote marks and so on. 
<li>If you have installed Emacs packages in non-standard directories,
you need to add them to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">load-path</span></samp>&rsquo; variable. For example,
here's how to add a couple of directories:
     <pre class="example">          (setq load-path
                (append "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp"
                        "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-site"
                        (expand-file-name "~lf/lisp")
                        load-path))
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Note the use of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">expand-file-name</span></samp>&rsquo; for dealing with non-absolute
directories. If you are a user in an account where you don't have root
priviledge, you are very likely to need to install your Emacs packages
in a non-standard directory. 
<li><em>FIXME: Explain how to get rid of the scrollbar</em>
<li>If you are a vi user, and you would like to run a vi editor under the
Emacs system, then read
<a href="Using-vi-emulation.html#Using-vi-emulation">Using vi emulation</a> for more details. 
<li>To use Emacs effectively, we recommend that you configure Dired and
bind certain function keys so that you can go in and out of Dired
effectively. Read <a href="Using-Emacs-as-an-IDE.html#Using-Emacs-as-an-IDE">Using Emacs as an IDE</a> for more configuration
details. 
<li>Autotools distributes two Emacs packages. One for handling copyright notices
and another one for handling Texinfo documentation. 
To set these packages up read
<a href="Inserting-copyright-notices-with-Emacs.html#Inserting-copyright-notices-with-Emacs">Inserting copyright notices with Emacs</a> and
<a href="GNU-Emacs-support-for-Texinfo.html#GNU-Emacs-support-for-Texinfo">GNU Emacs support for Texinfo</a>
<li>If you would like to use Emacs to read your email,
See <a href="Using-Emacs-as-an-email-client.html#Using-Emacs-as-an-email-client">Using Emacs as an email client</a> for more configuration information. 
</ul>
