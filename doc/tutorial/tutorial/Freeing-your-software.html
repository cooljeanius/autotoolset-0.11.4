<h3 class="section">A.3 Freeing your software</h3>

<p>Both copyright and patent laws are being used mainly to destroy our
<dfn>freedom</dfn> to cooperate with our fellow hackers. 
By freedom we refer to three things: the freedom to
use software, the freedom to modify it and improve it, and the freedom
to redistribute it with the modifications and improvements so that the
whole community benefits. Combined with the possible default assignment of
your rights to an employer or university, the laws can actually interfere
even with your ability to write computer programs for a hobby and cooperate
with other hackers on that basis!

   <p>To defend our freedoms from those
who would like to take them from us, the free software community uses the
General Public License, also known as the GPL. In broads strokes, the GPL
does the following:
     <ul>
<li>Grants you unrestricted permission to run the software and maintain as
many copies as you like. You can also make personal custom modifications
and use them freely. The GNU GPL does not restrict what you do in the
privacy of your own computer in any way. On the contrary it waives all
the restrictions that the copyright law applies to private use. 
It only kicks in when you
distribute the software you have received to other people. 
<li>Grants permission to redistribute the software or modified versions (derived
work) provided that you do so <strong>only</strong> under the terms of the GNU public
license. This means that if you make any changes, they must also be
free. This protects the freedom of the package by forbidding someone
to make a free version proprietary. This measure is called
<dfn>copyleft</dfn> because it subverts the copyright law to do the opposite of
what copyright is normally used for (i.e. to prevent a user to make a
proprietary package free). The GNU GPL does not oblidge you to distribute
your modifications. It only requires that you distribute them freely,
<em>if</em> you choose to distribute them at all. The decision of whether
or not to distribute your derived work is entirely up to you. 
The freedom to choose <em>not</em> to distribute your modifications is
as important as the freedom to distribute them. The GPL grants you both
freedoms. 
<li>Disclaims all warranty to protect the authors from lawsuits, including
various implied warranties such as the warranty for <dfn>merchantability</dfn>
and <dfn>fitness for a particular purpose</dfn>. 
<li>Protects the software's freedom from patents as much as this is possible. 
The scenario that we want to avoid is someone receiving the source code,
and then filing a patent application for the algorithms it uses, effectively
making the software proprietary. If you do that, the GPL will forbid you from
redistributing the software as well as derived work. So you will not want
to do it. The patent law itself will prevent someone else, who distributes
a competing product, to patent the algorithm if your implementation predates
his. 
</ul>

   <p>The purpose of the GPL is to use the copyright law to encourage a world in
which software is not copyrighted. If copyright didn't cover software, then
we would all be free to use, modify and redistribute software,
<em>and</em> we would not be able to restrict others from enjoying these
freedoms because there would be no law giving anyone such power. 
One way to grant the freedoms to the users of your software is
to revoke your copyright on the software completely. This is called putting
your work in the <dfn>public domain</dfn>. The problem with this is that it
only grants the freedoms. It does not create the reality in which no-one
can take these freedoms away from derived works. In fact the copyright law
covers by default derived works regardless of whether the original was
public domain or copyrighted. By distributing your work under the GPL,
you grant the same freedoms, and at the same time you protect these freedoms
from hoarders.

   <p>The GNU GPL is a legal instrument that has been
designed to create a
safe haven in which software can be written free from copyright law
encumberence. It allows developers to freely share their work with
a friendly community that is also willing to share theirs, and at the
same time protect them from being exploited by publishers of proprietary
software. Many developers would not contribute to our community without
this protection.

   <p>To apply the GPL to your programs you need to do the following things:
     <ul>
<li>Attach a copy of the GNU public license to the toplevel directory of your
source code in a file called <samp><span class="file">COPYING</span></samp>. 
<li>Include a legal notice to <em>every</em> file that you want covered by the GPL,
saying that it is covered by the GPL. It is important that all files that
constitute source code must include this notice, including <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp> files and shell scripts. 
The legal notice should look like this:
     <pre class="example">          // Copyright (C) (years) (Your Name) &lt;your@email.address&gt;
          //
          // This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
          // modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
          // as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
          // version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later
          // version.
          //
          // This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
          // but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
          // MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
          // GNU General Public License for more details.
          //
          // You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
          // along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
          // Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">If you have assigned your copyright to an organization, like the Free
Software Foundation, then you should probably fashion your copyright
notice like this:
     <pre class="example">          // Copyright (C) (years) Free Software Foundation
          // (your name) &lt;your@email.address&gt; (initial year)
          // etc...
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">This legal notice works like a subroutine. By invoking it, you invoke the
full text of the GNU General Public License which is too lengthy to include
in every source file. Where you see &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(years)</span></samp>&rsquo; you need to list all the
years in which you finished preparing a version that was actually released,
and which was an ancestor to the current version. This list is
<em>not</em> the list of years in which versions were released. It is a list
of years in which versions, later released, were completed. If you finish
a version on Dec 31, 1997 and release it on Jan 1, 1998, you need to
include 1997, but you do not need to include 1998. This rule is complicated,
but it is dictated by international copyright law. 
<li>Use the <samp><span class="file">AUTHORS</span></samp> file to keep records of who wrote what. These
records will be important if you decide at some point to register your
copyright. They are also important if you plan to assign your work to the
FSF, because they will want to register the copyright. 
We discuss this in more detail later. 
<li>If you modify someone else's GPL covered file make sure to comply with
section 2 of the GPL. To do that place notices stating that you changed
the file and the date of the change. Also your program should advertise the
fact that it is free software, that there is no warranty and that it can
be redistributed under the condition of the GPL. A standard way of doing
this is to make your program output this notice when it is passed the
<code>--version</code> command-line flag. For details please read the GPL. 
</ul>

   <p>If you are unfamiliar with all this legalese you may find it surprising;
you might even find it stupid. This is a very natural reaction. Until 1980,
software copyright was not taken seriously in the US. In fact copyrights
then had to be registered in order to be valid, and it was very natural
for people to just copy software around, even though they knew it was
illegal. It took significant amounts of
lobbying and
propaganda by proprietary publishers to cultivate the current litigious
paranoia over copyrights and &ldquo;convince&rdquo; the public that helping out their
neighbour by giving them an unauthorized copy is not only illegal, but
it also &ldquo;morally wrong&rdquo;. Even though
copyright laws are international, through treaties,
there are many countries in the world, where this brainwashing hasn't yet
taken place, and where people still make unauthorized copies of software for
their friends with no second thoughts. Such people are being described
with smear words like &ldquo;pirates&rdquo; by publishers and their lawyers, but
it is not true that these people do what they do because of a malicious
intent. These people do what they do, because it is natural for them to
be nice and help their friends.

   <p>One problem with this attitude is that many of us don't want to disobey
the law, because copyright is an indiscriminate weapon that cuts both ways. 
We prefer therefore to beat the hoarders at their own game. This means
that we can not use, modify or distribute programs that are not
distributed with a copyright notice and appropriate permissions, because
the default status of such programs is that
<em>no permissions are granted whatsoever</em>. 
If you write a program that you want to share with other people,
then please apply the terms of the GPL to the copies that you distribute,
so that your friends can use, modify and share the program with their
friends, without breaking any laws and to protect your contribution
to our community from the hoarders. Please do not violate copyright law. 
Instead, say no to proprietary software and use free software on the
free GNU/Linux operating system.
