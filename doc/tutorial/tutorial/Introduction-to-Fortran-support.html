<h3 class="section">8.1 Introduction to Fortran support</h3>

<p>This chapter is devoted to Fortran. We will show you how to build programs
that combine Fortran and C or C++ code in a portable manner. The main reason
for wanting to do this is because there is a lot of free software written
in Fortran. If you browse &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">http://www.netlib.org/</span></samp>&rsquo; you will find a
repository of lots of old, archaic, but very reliable free sources. 
These programs encapsulate a lot of experience in numerical analysis research
over the last couple of decades, which is crucial to getting work done. 
All of these sources
have been written in Fortran. As a developer today, if you know other
programming languages, it is unlikely that you
will want to write original code in Fortran. You may need, however, to use
legacy Fortran code, or the code of a neighbour who still writes in Fortran.

   <p>The most portable way to mix Fortran with your C/C++ programs is to translate
the Fortran code to C with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f2c</span></samp>&rsquo; compiler and compile everything with
a C/C++ compiler. The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f2c</span></samp>&rsquo; compiler is available at
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">http://www.netlib.org/</span></samp>&rsquo; but as we will soon explain, it is also
distributed with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">autotools</span></samp>&rsquo; package. Another alternative is to use
the GNU Fortran compiler &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g77</span></samp>&rsquo; with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g++</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gcc</span></samp>&rsquo;. This
compiler is portable among many platforms, so if you want to use a native
Fortran compiler without sacrificing portability, this is one way to do it. 
Another way is to use your OS's native Fortran compiler, which is usually
called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f77</span></samp>&rsquo;, <strong>if</strong> it is compatible with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g77</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f77</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Because performance is also very important in numerical codes, a good
strategy is to prefer to use the native compiler if it is compatible,
and support &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g77</span></samp>&rsquo; as a fall-back option. Because many sysadmins don't
install &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g77</span></samp>&rsquo; supporting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f2c</span></samp>&rsquo; as a third fall-back is also
a good idea.

   <p>Autotools provides support for configuring and building source code written
in part or in whole in Fortran. The implementation is based on the build
system used by GNU Octave, which has been generalized for use by any program.
