<h3 class="section">4.1 Direct compilation</h3>

<p>We begin at the beginning. If you recall, we showed to you that the hello
world program can be compiled very simply with the following command:
<pre class="example">     % gcc hello.c -o hello
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">See <a href="Hello-world-example.html#Hello-world-example">Hello world example</a>. 
Even in this simple case you have quite a few options:
     <ul>
<li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-g</span></samp>&rsquo; flag causes the compiler to output debugging information
to the executable. This way, you can step your program through a debugger
if it crashes. 
<li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-O</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-O2</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-O3</span></samp>&rsquo; flags activate <dfn>optimization</dfn>. 
Some compilers can go as far as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-O6</span></samp>&rsquo;. These numbers are called
<dfn>optimization levels</dfn>. When you compile your program with optimization
enabled, the compiler applies certain algorithms to the machine code output
to make it go faster. The cost is that your program compiles much more slowly
and that although you can step it through a debugger if you used the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-g</span></samp>&rsquo;
flag, things will be a little strange. During development the programmer
usually uses no optimization, and only activates it when he is about to
run the program for a production run. A good advice: always test your code
with optimization activated as well. 
If optimization breaks your code, then this is telling you that you have
a memory bug. Good luck finding it. 
<li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-Wall</span></samp>&rsquo; flag tells the compiler to issue warnings when it sees
bad programming style. Some of these warning catch actual bugs, but
occasionally some of the warnings complain about something correct that you
did on purpose. For this reason you control whether you want to see these
warnings or not with this flag. 
</ul>
   Here are some variations of the above example:
<pre class="example">     % gcc -g -O3 hello.c hello
     % gcc -g -Wall hello.c -o hello
     % gcc -g -Wall -O3 hello.c -o hello
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Compilers have many more flags like that, and some of these flags are
compiler dependent.

   <p>Now let's consider the case where you have a much larger program. 
made of source files <samp><span class="file">foo1.c</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">foo2.c</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">foo3.c</span></samp> and header files <samp><span class="file">header1.h</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">header2.h</span></samp>. 
One way to compile the program is like this:
<pre class="example">     % gcc foo1.c foo2.c foo3.c -o foo
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This is fine when you have only a few files to deal with. Eventually when
you have more than a hundred files, this is very slow and inefficient, because
everytime you change one of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; files, <strong>all</strong> of them have
to be recompiled. In large projects this can very well take a quite a few
minutes, and in very large projects hours. The solution is
to compile each part seperately and put them all together at the end, like
this:
<pre class="example">     % gcc -c foo1.c
     % gcc -c foo2.c
     % gcc -c foo3.c
     % gcc foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o -o foo
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first three lines compile the three parts seperately and generate output
in the files <samp><span class="file">foo1.o</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">foo2.o</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">foo3.o</span></samp>. The fourth line
puts it all back together. This way if you make a change only in <samp><span class="file">foo1.o</span></samp>
you just do:
<pre class="example">     % gcc -c foo1.c
     % gcc foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o -o foo
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This feature of the compiler offers a way out, but it's hardly a solution.

     <ul>
<li>Writing out these commands everytime becomes annoying very soon. 
<li>When it is a <strong>header</strong> file that you modified, you need to figure out
<em>which source files included it and rebuild all of them</em> for your
change to take effect. If you forget to rebuild just one of the source files,
this bug fix you just made may not work, and you will be all confused. 
<li> Once you are done compiling you have all these <samp><span class="file">.o</span></samp> files sitting around
and you may want to have a safe way of getting rid of them. Typing
     <pre class="example">          rm -f *.o
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">is dangerous because you may misspell &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>&rsquo; for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo; or you may
do this:
     <pre class="example">          rm -f * .o
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">and become depressed. 
</ul>

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo; utility was written to address these problems.
