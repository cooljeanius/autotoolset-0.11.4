<h2 class="unnumbered">Acknowledgements</h2>

<p class="noindent">This document and the Autotools package have originally been written by
Eleftherios Gkioulekas. Many people have further contributed to this
effort, directly or indirectly, in various way. Here is a list of these
people. Please help me keep it complete and exempt of errors.

     <ul>
<li>The appendix <em>Philosophical issues</em>
has been written by Richard Stallman. 
(see <a href="Philosophical-issues.html#Philosophical-issues">Philosophical issues</a>)
<li>The chapter on Fortran, and the Autotools support for developing software
that is partly written in Fortran is derived from the work of John Eaton
on GNU Octave, which I mainly generalized for use in other programs. 
(see <a href="Fortran-with-Autoconf.html#Fortran-with-Autoconf">Fortran with Autoconf</a>). 
<li>Mark Galassi was the first person, to the best of my knowledge, who tried to
write an Autoconf tutorial. It is thanks to his work that I was inspired to
begin this work. 
</ul>

   <p>FIXME: <em>I need to start keeping track of acknowledgements here</em>
