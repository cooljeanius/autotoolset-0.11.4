<h3 class="section">2.1 Why good code is important</h3>

<p>When you work on a software project, one of your short-term goals is to
solve a problem at hand. If you are doing this because someone asked you
to solve the problem, then all you need to do to look good in per eyes is to
deliver a program that works. Nevetheless, regardless of how little
person may appreciate this, doing just that is not good enough. 
Once you have code that gives the right answer to a specific set of problems,
you will want to make improvements to it. As you make these improvements,
you would like to have proof that your code's known reliability hasn't
regressed. Also, tomorrow you will want to move on to a different
set of related problems by repeating as little work as possible. Finally,
one day you may want to
pass the project on to someone else or recruit another developer to help you
out with certain parts. You need to make it possible for the
other person to get up to speed without reinventing your efforts. 
To accomplish these equally important goals you need to write
<em>good</em> code.
