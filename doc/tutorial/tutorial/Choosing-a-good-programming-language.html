<h3 class="section">2.2 Choosing a good programming language</h3>

<p>To write a good software, you must use the appropriate programming language
and use it well. To make your software free, it should be possible to
compile it with free tools on a free operating system. Therefore, you
should avoid using programming languages that do not have a free compiler.

   <p>The C programming language is the native language of GNU, and the GNU coding
standards
encourage you to program in C. The main advantages of C are that it can be
compiled with the system's native compiler, many people know C, and it is
easy to learn. Nevertheless, C has weaknesses: it forces you to manually manage
memory allocation, and any mistakes you might make can lead to very
difficult bugs. Also C forces you to program at a low level. Sometimes it is
desirable to program at a low level, but there are also cases where you want
to build on a higher level.

   <p>For projects where you would like a higher-level <em>compiled</em> language,
the recommended choice is to use C++. 
The GNU project distributes a free C++ compiler and nowadays most GNU systems
that have a C compiler also have the free C++ compiler. The main advantage of
C++ is that it will automatically manage dynamic memory allocation for you. 
C++ also has a lot of powerful features that allow you to program at a
higher level than C, bringing you closer to the algorithms and the concepts
involved, and making it easier to write robust programs. At the same time,
C++ does not hide low-level details from you and you have the freedom to
do the same low-level hacks that you had in C, if you choose to. 
In fact C++ is 99% backwards compatible with C and it is very easy
to mix C and C++ code. Finally, C++ is
an industry standard. As a result, it has been used to solve a variety of
real-world problems and its specification has evolved
for many years to make it a powerful and mature
language that can tackle such problems effectively. The C++ specification
was frozen and became an ANSI standard in 1998.

   <p>One of the disadvantages of C++ is that C++ object files compiled by
different C++ compilers can not be linked together. 
In order to compile C++ to machine language, a lot of compilation issues
need to be defered to the linking stage. Because object file formats
are not traditionally sophisticated enough to handle these issues, C++
compilers do various ugly kludges. The problem is that different compilers
do these kludges differently, making object files accross compilers
incompatible. This is not a terrible problem, since object files are
incompatible accross different platforms anyways. It is only a problem
when you want to use more than one compiler on the same platform. 
Another disadvantage of C++ is that it is harder
to interface a C++ library to another language, than it is to interface
a C library. Finally not as many people know C++ as well as they know C,
and C++ is a very extensive and difficult language to master. 
However these disadvantages must be weighted against the advantages. 
There is a price to using C++ but the price comes with a reward.

   <p>If you need a higher-level <em>interpreted</em> language, then the recommended
choice is to use Guile. Guile is the GNU variant of Scheme, a LISP-like
programming language. Guile is an interpreted language, and you can write
full programs in Guile, or use the Guile interpreter interactively. 
Guile is compatible with the R4RS standard but
provides a lot of GNU extensions. The GNU extensions are so extensive that
it is possible to write entire applications in Guile. Most of the low-level
facilities that are available in C, are also available in Guile.

   <p>What makes the Guile implementation of
Scheme special is not the extensions themselves, but the fact that it
it is very easy for any developer to add their own extensions to Guile, by
implementing them in C. 
By combining C and Guile you
leverage the advantages of both compiled and interpreted languages. 
Performance critical functionality can be implemented in C and
higher-level software development can be done in Guile. 
Also, because Guile is interpreted, when you make your C code available
through an extended Guile interpreter, then the user can also use the
functionality of that code interactively through the interpreter.

   <p>The idea of extensible interpreted languages is not new. 
Other examples of extensible interpreted languages are Perl, Python and Tcl. 
What sets Guile apart from these languages is the elegance of Scheme. 
Scheme is the holy grail in the quest for a programming language that
can be extended to support any programming paradigm by using the least
amount of syntax. Scheme has natural support for both arbitrary precision
integer arithmetic and floating point arithmetic. The simplicity of
Scheme syntax, and the completeness of Guile, make it very easy to
implement specialized scripting languages simply by translating them to
Scheme. In Scheme algorithms and data are interchangable. As a result,
it is easy to write Scheme programs that manipulate Scheme source code. 
This makes Scheme an ideal language for writing programs that manipulate
algorithms instead of data, such as programs that do symbolic algebra. 
Because Scheme can manipulate its own source code, a Scheme program can
save its state by writing Scheme source code into a file, and by parsing
it later to load it back up again. This feature alone is one reason why
engineers should use Guile to configure and drive numerical simulations.

   <p>Some people like to use Fortran 77. 
This is in many ways a good language for developing the
computational core of scientific applications. We do have free compilers
for Fortran 77, so using it does not restrict our freedom. 
(see <a href="Fortran-with-Autoconf.html#Fortran-with-Autoconf">Fortran with Autoconf</a>)
Also, Fortran 77 is an aggresively optimizable language, and this makes it
very attractive to engineers that want to write code optimized for speed. 
Unfortunately,
Fortran 77 can not do well <em>anything</em> except array-oriented
numerical computations. 
Managing input/output is unnecessarily difficult with Fortran,
and there's even computational areas, such as infinite precision integer
arithmetic and symbolic computation that are not supported.

   <p>There are many variants of Fortran like Fortran 90, and HPF. 
Fortran 90 attempts, quite miserably, to make Fortran 77 more like
C++. HPF allows engineers to write numerical code that runs on parallel
computers. These variants should be avoided for two reasons:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>There are no free compilers for Fortran 90 or HPF. 
If you happen to use a proprietary
operating system, you might as well make use of proprietary compilers
if they generate highly optimized code and that is important to you. 
Nevertheless, in order for your software to be freed, it should be
possible to compile it with free tools on a free operating system. 
Because it is possible to make parallel computers using GNU/Linux
(see the Beowulf project), parallelized software can also be free. 
Therefore both Fortran 90 and HPF should be avoided. 
<li>Another problem with these variants is that they are ad hoc languages
that have been invented to enable Fortran to do things that it can not
do by design. Eventually, when engineers will like to do things that Fortran
90 can't do either, it will be necessary to extend Fortran again, rewrite the
compilers and produce yet another variant. What engineers need is a
programming language that has the ability to self extend itself by writing
software in the same programming language. The C++ programming language
can do this without loss of performance. The departmentalization of
disciplines in academia has made it very difficult for such a project
to take off. Despite that, there is ongoing research in this area. 
(for example, see the Blitz++ project)
        </ol>
It is almost impossible to write good programs entirely in Fortran, so
please use Fortran only for the numerical core of your application
and do the bookeeping tasks, including input/output using a more appropriate
language.

   <p>If you have written a program entirely in Fortran, please do not ask anyone
else to maintain your code, unless person is like you and also knows only
Fortran. If Fortran is the only language that you know, then please learn
at least C and C++ and use Fortran only when necessary. Please do not
hold the opinion that contributions in science and engineering
are &ldquo;true&rdquo; contributions and software development is just a &ldquo;tool&rdquo;. 
This bigotted attitude is behind the thousands of lines of ugly unmaintainable
code that goes around in many places. Good software development can be
an important contribution in its own right, and regardless of what your
goals are, please appreciate it and encourage it. To maximize the benefits
of good software, please make your software free.
