<h3 class="section">5.6 Programs and Libraries with Automake</h3>

<p>Next we explain how to develop <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> files for the source code
directory levels. A <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> is a set of assignments. 
These assignments imply the Makefile, a set of targets, dependencies
and rules, and the Makefile implies the execution of building.

   <p>The first set of assignments going at the beginning look like this:
<pre class="example">     INCLUDES = -I/dir1 -I/dir2 -I/dir3 ....
     LDFLAGS = -L/dir1 -L/dir2 -L/dir3 ....
     LDADD = -llib1 -llib2 -llib3 ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">
     <ul>
<li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">INCLUDES</span></samp>&rsquo; assignment is where you insert the <code>-I</code> flags that
you need to pass to your compiler. If the stuff in this directory is
dependent on a library in another directory of the same package, then
the <code>-I</code> flag must point to that directory. 
<li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">LDFLAGS</span></samp>&rsquo; assignment is where you insert the <code>-L</code> flags
that are needed by the compiler when it links all the object files to
an executable. 
<li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">LDADD</span></samp>&rsquo; assignment is where you list a long set of installed
libraries that you want to link in with all of your executables. 
Use the <code>-l</code> flag only for installed libraries. You can list
libraries that have been built but not installed yet as well, but
do this only be providing the full path to these libraries. 
</ul>
   If your package contains subdirectories with libraries and you want to
link these libraries in another subdirectory you need to put &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-I</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-L</span></samp>&rsquo; flags in the two variables above. To express the path to
these other subdirectories, use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(top_srcdir)</span></samp>&rsquo; variable. 
For example if you want to access a library under <samp><span class="file">src/libfoo</span></samp>
you can put something like:
<pre class="example">     INCLUDES = ... -I$(top_srcdir)/src/libfoo ...
     LDFLAGS  = ... -L$(top_srcdir)/src/libfoo ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">on the <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> of every directory level that wants access to
these libraries. Also, you must make sure that the libraries are built
before the directory level is built. To guarantee that, list the library
directories in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">SUBDIRS</span></samp>&rsquo; <strong>before</strong> the directory levels that
depend on it. One way to do this is to put all the library directories under
a <samp><span class="file">lib</span></samp> directory and all the executable directories under a <samp><span class="file">bin</span></samp>
directory and on the <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> for the directory level that
contains <samp><span class="file">lib</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">bin</span></samp> list them as:
<pre class="example">     SUBDIRS = lib bin
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This will guarantee that all the libraries are available before building
any executables. Alternatively, you can simply order your directories
in such a way so that the library directories are built first.

   <p>Next we list the things that are to be built in this directory level:
<pre class="example">     bin_PROGRAMS    = prog1 prog2 prog3 ....
     lib_LIBRARIES   = libfoo1.a libfoo2.a libfoo3.a ....
     check_PROGRAMS  = test1 test2 test3 ....
     TESTS           = $(check_PROGRAMS)
     include_HEADERS = header1.h header2.h ....
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">
     <ul>
<li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bin_PROGRAMS</span></samp>&rsquo; line lists all the executable files that will be
compiled with <code>make</code> and installed with <code>make install</code> under
<samp><span class="file">/prefix/bin</span></samp>, where <samp><span class="file">prefix</span></samp> is usually <samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp>. 
<li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lib_LIBRARIES</span></samp>&rsquo; line lists all the library files that will be
compiled with <code>make</code> and installed with <code>make install</code> under
<samp><span class="file">/prefix/lib</span></samp>. 
<li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">check_PROGRAMS</span></samp>&rsquo; line lists executable files that are
<strong>not</strong> compiled with a simple <code>make</code> but only with a
<code>make check</code>. These programs serve as tests that you, the user
can use to test the library. 
<li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">TESTS</span></samp>&rsquo; line lists executable files which are to be compiled
<em>and executed</em> when you run <code>make check</code>. These programs
constitute the <dfn>test suite</dfn> and they are indispensible when you
develop a library. It is common to just set
     <pre class="example">          TESTS = $(check_PROGRAMS)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">This way by commenting the line in and out, you can modify the behaviour
of <code>make check</code>. While debugging your test suite, you will want to
comment out this line so that <code>make check</code> doesn't run it. However,
in the end product, you will want to comment it back in. 
<li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">include_HEADERS</span></samp>&rsquo; line lists public headers present in this
directory that you want to install in <code>/prefix/include</code>. You must
list a header file here if you want to cause it to be installed. You
can also list it under <code>libfoo_a_SOURCES</code> for the library that it
belongs to, but it is imperative to list public headers here so that they
can be installed. 
</ul>
   It is good programming practice to keep libraries and executables under
seperate directory levels. However, it is okey to keep the library and
the <em>check</em> executables that test the library under the same directory
level because that makes it easier for you to link them with the library.

   <p>For each of these types of targets, we must state information that
will allow <code>automake</code> and <code>make</code> to infer the building process.

     <ul>
<li><strong>For each Program:</strong> You need to declare the set of files that are
sources of the program, the set of libraries that must be linked with the
program and (optionally) a set of dependencies that need to be built before
the program is built. These are declared in assignments that look like
this:
     <pre class="example">          prog1_SOURCES = foo1.cc foo2.cc ... header1.h header2.h ....
          prog1_LDADD   = -lbar1 -lbar2 -lbar3
          prog1_LDFLAGS = -L/dir1 -L/dir2 -L/dir3 ...
          prog1_DEPENDENCIES = dep1 dep2 dep3 ...
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">In each assignment substitute &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">prog1</span></samp>&rsquo; with the name of the program that
you are building as it appeared in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bin_PROGRAMS</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">check_PROGRAMS</span></samp>&rsquo;.
          <ul>
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">prog1_SOURCES</span></samp>&rsquo;: Here you list all the <samp><span class="file">*.cc</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">*.h</span></samp> files
that compose the source code of the program. The presense of a header file
here doesn't cause the file to be installed at <samp><span class="file">/prefix/include</span></samp> but
it does cause it to be added to the distribution when you do <code>make dist</code>. 
To cause header files to be installed you must also put them in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">include_HEADERS</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">prog1_LDADD</span></samp>&rsquo;: Here you add primarily the <code>-l</code> flags for linking
whatever libraries are needed by your code. You may also list object files,
which have been compiled in an exotic way, as well as paths to uninstalled
yet libraries. 
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">prog_LDFLAGS</span></samp>&rsquo;: Here you add the <code>-L</code> flags that are needed to
resolve the libraries you passed in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">prog_LDADD</span></samp>&rsquo;. Certain flags that
need to be passed on <em>every</em> program can be expressed on a global
basis by assigning them at &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">LDFLAGS</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">prog1_DEPENDENCIES</span></samp>&rsquo;:
If for any reason you want certain other targets to be built before building
this program, you can list them here. 
</ul>
     This is all you need to do. There is no need to write an extended Makefile
with all the targets, dependencies and rules that are required to build
the program. They are computed for you by this minimal information by
<samp><span class="file">automake</span></samp>. Moreover, the targets &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dist</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">install</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">clean</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">distclean</span></samp>&rsquo; are appropriately setup to handle the
program. You don't need to take care of them by yourself.

     <li><strong>For each Library:</strong>
There's a total of four assignments that are relevant to building libraries:
     <pre class="example">          lib_LIBRARIES = ... libfoo1.a ...
          libfoo1_a_SOURCES      = foo1.cc foo2.cc private1.h private2.h ...
          libfoo1_a_LIBADD       = obj1.o obj2.o obj3.o
          libfoo1_a_DEPENDENCIES = dep1 dep2 dep3 ...
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Note that if the name of the library is <samp><span class="file">libfoo1.a</span></samp> the prefix that
appears in the variables that are related with that library is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libfoo1_a_</span></samp>&rsquo;.
          <ul>
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libfoo1_a_SOURCES</span></samp>&rsquo;: Just like with programs, here you list all the
<samp><span class="file">*.cc</span></samp> files as well as all the <strong>private</strong> header files that
compose the library. By <dfn>private header file</dfn> we mean a header file
that is used internally by the library and the maintainers of the library,
but is not exported to the end-user. You can list <dfn>public header files</dfn>
also if you like, and perhaps you should for documentation purposes, but
if you mention them in <code>include_HEADERS</code> it is not required to repeat
them a second time here. 
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libfoo1_a_DEPENDENCIES</span></samp>&rsquo;: If there are any other targets that need to
be built before this library is built, list them here. 
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libfoo1_a_LIBADD</span></samp>&rsquo;: If there are any other object files that you want
to include in the library list them here. You might be tempted to list
them as dependencies in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libfoo1_a_DEPENDENCIES</span></samp>&rsquo;, but that will not
work. If you do that, the object files will be built before the library
is built <em>but they will not be included in the library!</em> By listing
an object file here, you are stating that you want it to be built <strong>and</strong>
you want it to be included in the library. 
</ul>
     </ul>
