<h3 class="section">8.5 Portability problems with Fortran</h3>

<p>Fortran is infested with portability problems. There exist two important
Fortran standards: one that was written in 1966 and one that was written
in 1977. The 1977 standard is considered to be <em>the</em> standard Fortran. 
Most of the Fortran code is written by scientists who have never had any
formal training in computer programming. As a result, they often write
code that is dependent on vendor-extensions to the standard, and not
necessarily easy to port. The standard itself is to blame as well, since
it is sorely lacking in many aspects. For example, even though standard
Fortran has both <code>REAL</code> and <code>DOUBLE PRECISION</code> data types
(corresponding to <code>float</code> and <code>double</code>) the standard only
supports single precision complex numbers (<code>COMPLEX</code>). Since many
people will also want double precision complex numbers, many vendors provided
extensions. Most commonly, the double precision complex number is called
<code>COMPLEX*16</code> but you might also see it called <code>DOUBLE COMPLEX</code>. 
Other such vendors extensions include providing a <code>flush</code> operation
of some sort for file I/O, and other such esoteric things.

   <p>To make things
worse (or better) now there are two more standards out there: the 1990
standard and the 1995 standard. A 2000 standard is also at work. 
Fortran 90 and its successors try to make Fortran more like C and C++, and
even though <em>there are no free compilers</em> for both variants,
they are becoming alarmingly popular with the scientific community. 
In fact, I think that the main reason why these variants of Fortran are
being developed is to make more bussiness for proprietary compiler
developers. So far as I know, Fortran 90 does not provide any features
that C++ can not  support with a class library extension. Moreover
Fortran 90 does not have the comprehensive foundation that allows C++ to be
a self-extensible language. This makes it less worthwhile to invest effort
on Fortran 90, because it means that eventually people will want features that
can only be implemented by redefining the language and rewriting the
compilers for it. Instead, in C++, you can add features to the language
simply by writing C++ code, because it has enough core features to allow
virtually unlimited self-extensibility.

   <p>If your primary interest is portability and free software, you should stay
away from Fortran
90 as well as Fortran 95, until someone writes a free compiler for them. 
You will be better off developing in <code>C++</code> and only migrating to
Fortran 77 the parts that are performance critical. This way you get the
best of both worlds.

   <p>On the flip side, if you limit your Fortran code just to number-crunching,
then it becomes much easier to write portable code. There are still a few
things you should take into account however. 
Some Fortran code has been written in the archaic 1966 style. An example
of such code is the <code>fftpack</code> package from <code>netlib</code>. The main
problems with such code are the following:
     <ul>
<li><strong>Implicit types</strong>:
In Fortran 66, programmers were too lazy to define the types of their variables. 
The idea was that the type was inferred by the first letter of the variable
name. That's horror for you! The convention then is that all variables with
initial <code>I,J,...,N</code> are type <code>INTEGER</code>. All others are <code>REAL</code>
To compile this code with
modern compilers it is necessary to add the following line to every source
file:
     <pre class="example">          IMPLICIT DOUBLE PRECISION (A-H,O-Z)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">This instructs the compiler to do the right thing, which is to implicitly
assume that all variables starting with <code>A-H</code> and <code>O-Z</code> are
double precision and all other variables are integers. Alternatively you can
say
     <pre class="example">          IMPLICIT REAL (A-H,O-Z)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">but it is very rarely that you will ever want to go with single precision. 
Occasionally, you may find that the programmer breaks the rules. For example,
in <code>fftpack</code> the array <code>IFAC</code> is supposed to be a <code>double</code>
even though implicitly it is suggested to be an <code>int</code>. Such inconstances
will probably show up in compiler errors. To fix them, declare the type
of these variables explicitly. If it's an array then you do it like this:
     <pre class="example">          DOUBLE PRECISION IFAC(*)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">If the variable also appears in a <code>DIMENSION</code> declaration, then you
should remove it from the declaration since the two can't coexist in
<em>some</em> compilers. 
<li><strong>Pseudo-pointers</strong>:
In archaic Fortran, a dimension declaration of the form:
     <pre class="example">          DIMENSION C(1)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">means that <code>C</code> has an unknown length, instead of meaning that it has
length 1. In modern Fortran, this is an unacceptable notation and modern
compilers do get confused over it. So all such instances must be replaced
with the correct form which is:
     <pre class="example">          DIMENSION C(*)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Such &ldquo;arrays&rdquo; in reality are just pointers. The user can reference the
array as far as he likes, but of course, if he takes it too far, the
program will either do the Wrong Thing or crash with a segmentation fault. 
<li><strong>Constants</strong>:
A most insidious problem has to do with constants and it is confined, to
the best of my knowledge, to the GNU Fortran compiler, but it could
very well be a problem in other compilers to which I have no access to. 
Constants tend to appear in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">DATA</span></samp>&rsquo; statements or variable assignments. 
The problem is that whenever a constant is in use, the context is never
a determining factor for the <dfn>type</dfn> of the constant, unlike C which
does automatic casting. Examples: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo; is always type <code>INTEGER</code>,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">9.435784839284958</span></samp>&rsquo; is always type <code>REAL</code>
(even if the additional precision specified is lost, and even when used in
a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">DOUBLE PRECISION</span></samp>&rsquo; context such as being assigned to a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">DOUBLE PRECISION</span></samp>&rsquo; variable!). On the other hand, <code>1E0</code> is
always <code>REAL</code> and <code>1D0</code> is always &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">DOUBLE PRECISION</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
If you want your code to be exclusively double precision, then you should
scan the entire source for constants, and make sure that they all have the
<code>D0</code> suffix at the end. Many compilers will tolerate this omission while
others will not and go ahead and introduce single precision error to your
computations leading to hard to find bugs. 
</ul>

   <p>In general the code in <code>http://www.netlib.org/</code> is very reliable and
portable, but you do need to keep your eyes open for little problems like
the above.
