<h3 class="section">8.4 The gory details</h3>

<p>The best way to get started is by building the initial directory tree with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">acmkdir</span></samp>&rsquo; like this:
<pre class="example">     % acmkdir -t fortran &lt;directory-filename&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This will install all the standard stuff. It will also install a directory
called <samp><span class="file">fortran</span></samp> containing a copy of the f2c compiler and
<samp><span class="file">f2c_comp</span></samp>, a shell script invoking the compiler in a way that it
looks the same as invoking a real compiler

   <p>The file <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp> uses the following special macros:
     <dl>
<dt><strong>LF_PROG_F77_PREFER_F2C_COMPATIBILITY</strong><dd>This macro directs Autoconf that the user prefers <code>f2c</code> compatibility
over performance. In general Fortran programmers are willing to sacrifice
everything for the sake of performance. However, if you want to use
Fortran code with C and C++ code, you will have many reasons to also
give importance to <code>f2c</code> compatibility. Use this macro to state this
preference. The effect is that if the installer's platform has a native
Fortran compiler installed, it will be used only if it is <code>f2c</code>
compatible. This macro must be invoked before invoking
<code>LF_PROG_F77</code>. 
<br><dt><strong>LF_PROG_F77_PREFER_NATIVE_VERSION</strong><dd>This macro directs Autoconf that the user prefers performance and
doesn't care about <code>f2c</code> compatibility. You may want to invoke this
instead if your entire program is written in Fortran. 
This macro must be invoked before invoking <code>LF_PROG_F77</code>. 
<br><dt><strong>LF_PROG_F77</strong><dd>This macro probes the installer platform for an appropriate Fortran
compiler. It exports the following variables to Automake:
          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F77</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The name of the Fortran compiler
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FFLAGS</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Flags for the Fortran compiler
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FLIBS</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The link sequence for the compiler runtime libraries
</dl>
     It also checks whether the compiler appends underscores to the symbols
and whether the symbols are written in lowercase or uppercase characters
and defines the following preprocessor macros:
          <dl>
<dt><code>F77_APPEND_UNDERSCORE</code><dd>Define if the compiler appends an underscore to the symbol names. 
<br><dt><code>F77_UPPERCASE_NAMES</code><dd>Define if the compiler uses uppercase for symbol names. 
</dl>
     These macros are used to define &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f77func</span></samp>&rsquo; macro which takes two arguments;
the name of the Fortan subroutine or function in lower case, and then in
upper case, and returns the correct symbol name to use for invoking it from
C or C++. To obtain the calling sequence for the symbol do:
     <pre class="example">          % f2c -P foo.f
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">on the file containing the subroutine and examine the file <samp><span class="file">foo.P</span></samp>. 
In order for this macro to work properly you must precede it with calls
to
     <pre class="example">          AC_PROG_CC
          AC_PROG_RANLIB
          LF_HOST_TYPE
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">You also need to call one of the two <code>*_PREFER_*</code> macros. The default
is to prefer <code>f2c</code> compatibility. 
</dl>
   In addition to invoking all of the above, you need to make provision for
the bundled fortran compiler by adding the following lines at the end of
your <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp>:
<pre class="example">     AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS(fortran/f2c fortran/libf2c)
     AC_OUTPUT([Makefile fortran/Makefile f2c_comp
                doc/Makefile m4/Makefile src/Makefile])
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <code>AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS</code> macro directs <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> to execute the
configure scripts in <samp><span class="file">fortran/f2c</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">fortran/libf2c</span></samp>. 
The stuff in <code>AC_OUTPUT</code> that are important to Fortran support are
building <samp><span class="file">fortran/Makefile</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">f2c_comp</span></samp>. Because,
<samp><span class="file">f2c_comp</span></samp> is mention in <code>AC_OUTPUT</code>, Automake will automagically
bundle it when you build a source code distribution.

   <p>If you have originally set up your directory tree for a C or C++ only
project and later you realize that you need to also use Fortran, you can
upgrade your directory tree to Fortran as follows:
     <ul>
<li>Create the <samp><span class="file">fortran</span></samp> directory by invoking
     <pre class="example">          % mkfortran
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">and the <samp><span class="file">f2c_oomp</span></samp> by invoking
     <pre class="example">          % mkf2c_comp
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">both on the toplevel directory level. 
<li>Add the following macro invokations in the middle of <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp>, in
this order:
     <pre class="example">          AC_PROG_CC
          AC_PROG_RANLIB
          LF_HOST_TYPE
          LF_PROG_F77_PREFER_F2C_COMPATIBILITY
          LF_PROG_F77
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">If you have invoked <code>LF_CONFIGURE_CC</code> then there is no need to
invoke <code>AC_PROG_CC</code> again. 
<li>Add the following invokation just before <code>AC_OUTPUT</code>:
     <pre class="example">          AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS([fortran/f2c fortran/libf2c])
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">and add the following files to <code>AC_OUTPUT</code>:
     <pre class="example">          fortran/Makefile f2c_comp
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"><li>Rebuild with
     <pre class="example">          % make distclean
          % ./reconf
          % ./configure
          % make
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">It is important to call <samp><span class="file">reconf</span></samp> for the changes to take effect. 
</ul>

   <p>If a directory level contains Fortran source code, then it is important
to let Automake know about it by adding the following lines in the
beginning.
<pre class="example">     SUFFIXES = .f
     .f.o:
             $(F77) -c $&lt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This is pretty much the same idea with the embedded text compiler. 
You can list the Fortran source code filenames in the <code>SOURCES</code>
assignments together with your C and C++ code. To link executables,
you must add <code>$(FLIBS)</code> to <code>LDADD</code> and link against
<samp><span class="file">f2c-main.c</span></samp> just as in the hello world example. Please do
not include <samp><span class="file">f2c-main.c</span></samp> in any libraries however.

   <p>Now consider the file <samp><span class="file">hello.cc</span></samp> line by line. 
First we include the standard configuration stuff:
<pre class="example">     #ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
     #include &lt;config.h&gt;
     #endif
     #include &lt;string.h&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Then we include the Fortran related header files:
<pre class="example">     #include "f2c.h"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Then we declare the prototypes for the Fortran subroutine:
<pre class="example">     extern "C"
     {
      extern int f77func(fhello,FHELLO)(char *c__, ftnlen c_len);
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">There is a few things to note here:
     <ul>
<li>You should never ever declare Fortran prototypes in header files. The
definition of prototypes is dependent on the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f77func</span></samp>&rsquo; macro,
which is dependent on a correct definition of the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F77_APPEND_UNDERSCORE</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F77_UPPERCASE_NAMES</span></samp>&rsquo; C preprocessor
macros. You should be nice and not force people who don't want to use Fortran
to have to get these macros defined in order to use your header files. 
If you want to export functionality written in Fortran to C users, then wrap
the Fortran subroutines and functions with corresponding C subroutines and
functions and export these instead on your header file. 
<li>You should never use the actual name of the Fortran routine in C, because
doing so is not portable. Instead you should use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f77func</span></samp>&rsquo; macro,
which takes two arguments: the name of the routine in small letters, and
the name of the routine in all-caps. The right name of the two is chosen,
and the underscore is appended if necessary. 
<li>If the source file in which you are writing down the Fortran declarations
is compiled with a C++ compiler, as is true in this case, then you must
surround the declarations with:
     <pre class="example">          extern "C"
          {
          }
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">The C++ language uses <dfn>name mangling</dfn> to support function overloading. 
This means that if you have two C++ functions called:
     <pre class="example">          int foo(double x);
          int foo(double x,double y);
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">the C++ compiler internally assigns them different names in an intelligent
fashion to avoid conflict. Just like the Fortran compiler does things
behind your back, so does the C++ compiler to support some of its special
features. Any code written between &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">extern "C"</span></samp>&rsquo; is compiled with name
mangling disabled. This is necessary for the Fortran declarations because
we don't want the names of the Fortran subroutines to be mangled. 
<li>When we actually invoke the Fortran subroutine in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">main</span></samp>&rsquo; we
make sure to type-cast all the types to what appears on the prototype
above. In this case we do:
     <pre class="example">          f77func(fhello,FHELLO)(s,ftnlen(strlen(s)));
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">This may seem pedantic but it is necessary for the C++ compiler,
and it is a good habit even for C programmers. Since Fortran routines
are supposed to be wrapped, this is not too much to ask. 
<li>You need to be very careful with integers. On some systems &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">long int</span></samp>&rsquo;
is 64 bit and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">int</span></samp>&rsquo; is 32 bit. This means that you should avoid
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">long int</span></samp>&rsquo; like the plague! The safest way to deal with integers is to
make sure that you always cast your integer stuff to <code>integer</code>
explicitly. Unfortunately the standard header file distributed with
<code>f2c</code> defines <code>integer</code> as <code>long int</code> to account for 16-bit
machines. That's a bad idea, and on the 64-bit Dec Alpha it is a bug. The
header file distributed with
<samp><span class="file">mkf2c</span></samp> does the right thing. 
<li>Make sure to list both <samp><span class="file">f2c.h</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">f2c-main.c</span></samp> in
<code>SOURCES</code> assignments on your <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> to make sure that
they are included in the source code distribution. 
</ul>
