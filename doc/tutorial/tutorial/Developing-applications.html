<h3 class="section">2.4 Developing applications</h3>

<p><dfn>Applications</dfn> are complete executable programs that can be run by the
end-user. With library-oriented development the actual functionality
is developed by writing libraries and debugged by developing test-suites
for each library. With command-line oriented applications, the application
source code parses the arguments that are passed to it by the user,
and calls up the right functions in the library to carry out the user's
requests. With GUI
<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
applications, the application source code creates the <dfn>widgets</dfn> that
compose the interface, binds them to <dfn>actions</dfn>, and then enters an
event loop. Each action is implemented in terms of the functionality
provided by the appropriate library.

   <p>It should be possible to implement applications by using relatively few
application-specific source files, since most of the functionality is
actually done in libraries. In some cases, the application is simple
enough that it would be an overkill to package its functionality as
a library. Nevertheless, in such cases please separate the source code
that handles actual functionality from the source code that handles
the user interface. Also, please always separate the code that handles
input/output with the code that does actual computations. 
If these aspects of your source code are sufficiently separated then you make
it easier for other people to reuse parts of your code in their applications. 
You also make it easier of yourself to switch to library-oriented
development when your application grows and is no longer &ldquo;simple enough&rdquo;.

   <p>Library-oriented development allows you to write good and robust applications. 
In return it requires discipline. Sometimes you may need to add
experimental functionality that is not available through your libraries. 
The right thing to do is to extend the appropriate library. 
The easy thing to do is to implement it as part of your application-specific
source code. If the feature is experimental and undergoing many changes,
it may be best to go with the easy approach at first. Still, when
the feature matures, please migrate it to the appropriate library, document
it, and take it out of the application source code. What we mean by
discipline is doing these migrations, when the time is right, despite
pressures from &ldquo;real life&rdquo;, such as deadlines, pointy-haired bosses,
and nuclear terrorism. A rule of thumb for deciding
when to migrate code to a library is when you find yourself cut-n-pasting
chunks of code from application to application. If you do not do the right
thing, your code will become increasingly harder to debug, harder to
maintain, and less reliable.

   <p>Applications should also be documented, especially the ones that are
command-line oriented. Application documentation should be thorough in
explaining to the user all the things that he needs to know to use
the application effectively and should be distributed separately
from the application itself. Nevertheless, applications should recognize
the <code>--help</code> switch and output a synopsis of how
the application is used. Applications should also recognize the
<code>--version</code> switch and state their version number. The easiest
way to make applications understand these two switches is to use the
GNU Argp library (<em>FIXME: crossreference</em>).
