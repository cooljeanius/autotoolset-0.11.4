<h3 class="section">6.8 Handling very deep packages</h3>

<p>When making a package, you can organize it as a <dfn>flat</dfn> package or
a <dfn>deep</dfn> package. In a flat package, all the source files are placed
under <code>src</code> without any subdirectory structure. In a deep package,
libraries and groups of executables are seperated by a subdirectory
structure. The perennial problem with deep packages is dealing with
interdirectory dependencies. What do you do if to compile one library you
need header files from another library in another directory? What do you do if
to compile the test suite of your library you need to link in another library
that has just been compiled in a different directory?

   <p>One approach is to just put all these interdependent things in the same
directory. This is not very unreasonable since the <code>Makefile.am</code>
can document quite thoroughly where each file belongs, in case you need to
split them up in the future. On the other hand, this solution becomes less
and less preferable as your project grows. You may not want to clutter
a directory with source code for too many different things. What do you
do then?

   <p>The second approach is to be careful about these dependencies and just
invoke the necessary features of Automake to make everything work out.

   <p>For <code>*.a</code> files (library binaries), the recommended thing to do
is to link them by giving the full relative pathname. Doing that allows
Automake to work out the dependencies correctly accross multiple directories. 
It also allows you to easily upgrade to shared libraries with Libtool. 
To retain some flexibility it may be best to list these interdirectory
link sequences in variables and then use these variables. This way, when you
move things around you minimize the amount of editing you have to do. 
In fact, if all you need these library binaries for is to build a test suite
you can simply assign them to <code>LDFLAGS</code>. To make these assignments
more uniform, you may want to start your pathnames with <code>$(top_builddir)</code>.

   <p>For <code>*.h</code> files (header files), you can include an
<pre class="example">     INCLUDES = -I../dir1 -I../dir2 -I../dir3 ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">assignment on every <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> of every directory level listing
the directories that contain include files that you want to use. If your
directory tree is very complicated, you may want to make these assignments
more uniform by starting your pathnames from <code>$(top_srcdir)</code>. 
In your source code, you should use the syntax
<pre class="example">     #include "foo.h"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">for include files in the current directory and
<pre class="example">     #include &lt;foo.h&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">for include files in other directories.

   <p>There is a better third approach, provided by Autotools, but it only
applies to include files. There is nothing more that can be done with
library binaries; you simply have to give the path. But with header files,
it is possible to arrange at configure-time that all header files are
symlinked under the directory <code>$(top_builddir)/include</code>. Then you will
only need to list one directory instead of many.

   <p>Autotools provides two Autoconf macros: <code>LF_LINK_HEADERS</code> and
<code>LF_SET_INCLUDES</code>, to handle this symlinking.
     <dl>
<dt><strong>LF_LINK_HEADERS</strong><dd>This macro links the public header files under a certain set of directories
under an include directory from the toplevel. A simple way to invoke this
macro is by listing the set of directories that contain public header files:
     <pre class="example">          LF_LINK_HEADERS(src/dir1 src/dir2 src/dir3 ... src/dirN)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">When this macro is invoked for the first time, the directory
<samp><span class="file">$(top_srcdir)/include</span></samp> is erased. Then for each directory
<samp><span class="file">src/dirK</span></samp> listed, we look for the file <samp><span class="file">src/dirK/Headers</span></samp> and
link the public header files mentioned in that file under
<samp><span class="file">$(top_srcdir)/include</span></samp>. The link will be either symbolic or hard,
depending on the capabilities of your operating system. If possible,
a symbolic link will be prefered.

     <p>You can invoke the same macro by passing an optional argument that specifies
a directory name. For example:
     <pre class="example">          LF_LINK_HEADERS(src/dir1 src/dir2 ... src/dirN , foo)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Then the symlinks will be created under the
<samp><span class="file">$(top_srcdir)/include/foo</span></samp> directory instead. This can be significantly
useful if you have very many header files to install and you'd like to
call them something like:
     <pre class="example">          #include &lt;foo/file1.h&gt;
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">During compilation, when you try to
<br><dt><strong>LF_SET_INCLUDES</strong><dd>This macro will cause the <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> variable
<code>$(default_includes)</code> to contain the correct collection of <code>-I</code>
flags, such that the include files are accessible. If you invoke it with
no arguments as
     <pre class="example">          LF_SET_INCLUDES
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">then the following assignment will take place:
     <pre class="example">          default_includes = -I$(prefix) -I$(top_srcdir)/include
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">If you invoke it with arguments:
     <pre class="example">          LF_SET_INCLUDES(dir1 dir2 ... dirN)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">then the following assignment will take place instead:
     <pre class="example">          default_includes = -I$(prefix) -I$(top_srcdir)/include/dir1 \
                             -I$(top_srcdir)/include/dir2 ...         \
                             -I$(top_srcdir)/include/dirN
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">You may use this variable as part of your <code>INCLUDES</code> assignment
in your <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> like this:
     <pre class="example">          INCLUDES = $(default_includes)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">If your distribution has a <samp><span class="file">lib</span></samp> directory, in which you install
various codelets and header files, then a path to that library is
added to <code>default_includes</code> also. In that case, you have one
of the following:
     <pre class="example">          default_includes = -I$(prefix) -I$(top_srcdir)/lib -I$(top_srcdir)/include
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">or
     <pre class="example">          default_includes = -I$(prefix) -I$(top_srcdir)/lib \
                             -I$(top_srcdir)/include/dir1 ... \
                             -I$)top_srcdir)/include/dirN
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"></dl>

   <p>A typical use of this system involves invoking
<pre class="example">     LF_LINK_HEADERS(src/dir1 src/dir2 ... src/dirN)
     LF_SET_INCLUDES
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">in your <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp> and adding the following two lines in your
<samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp>:
<pre class="example">     INCLUDES = $(default_includes)
     EXTRA_DIST = Headers
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The variable <code>$(default_includes)</code> will be assigned by the
<code>configure</code> script to point to the Right Thing. You will also
need to include a file called <samp><span class="file">Headers</span></samp> in every directory level
that you mention in <code>LF_LINK_HEADERS</code> containing the public header
files that you wish to symlink. The filenames need to be separated by
carriage returns in the <samp><span class="file">Headers</span></samp> file. You also need to mention
these public header files in a
<pre class="example">     include_HEADERS = foo1.h foo2.h ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">assignment, in your <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp>, to make sure that they are installed.

   <p>With this usage, other programs can access the installed header files
as:
<pre class="example">     #include &lt;foo1.h&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Other directories within the same package can access the uninstalled yet
header files in exactly the same manner. Finally, in the same directory
you should access the header files as
<pre class="example">     #include "foo1.h"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This will force the header file in the current directory to be installed,
even when there is a similar header file already installed. This is very
important when you are rebuilding a new version of an already installed
library. Otherwise, building might be confused if your code tries to
include the already installed, and not up-to-date, header files from the
older version.

   <p>Alternatively, you can categorize the header files under a directory,
by invoking
<pre class="example">     LF_LINK_HEADERS(src/dir1 src/dir2 , name1)
     LF_LINK_HEADERS(src/dir3 src/dir4 , name2)
     LF_SET_INCLUDES(name1 name2)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">in your <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp>. In your <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> files you still
add the same two lines:
<pre class="example">     INCLUDES = $(default_includes)
     EXTRA_DIST = Headers
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and maintain the <samp><span class="file">Headers</span></samp> file as before. However, now the header files
will be symlinked to subdirectories of <samp><span class="file">$(top_srcdir)/include</span></samp>. 
This means that although uninstalled header files in all directories must
be included by code in the same directory as:
<pre class="example">     #include "header.h"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">code in other directories must access these uninstalled header files as
<pre class="example">     #include &lt;name1/header.h&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">if the header file is under <samp><span class="file">src/dir1</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">src/dir2</span></samp> or as
<pre class="example">     #include &lt;name2/header.h&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">if the header file is under <samp><span class="file">src/dir3</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">src/dir4</span></samp>. 
It follows that you probably intend for these header files to be installed
correspondingly in such a manner so that other programs can also include them
the same way. To accomplish that, under <samp><span class="file">src/dir1</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">src/dir2</span></samp>
you should list the header files in your <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> like this:
<pre class="example">     name1dir = $(includedir)/name1
     name1_HEADERS = header.h ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and under <samp><span class="file">src/dir3</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">src/dir4</span></samp> like this:
<pre class="example">     name2dir = $(includedir)/name2
     name2_HEADERS = header.h
     
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">One disadvantage of this approach is that the source tree is modified
during configure-time, even during a VPATH build. Some may not like that, but
it suits me just fine. 
Unfortunately, because Automake requires the GNU compiler to compute
dependencies, the header files need to be placed in a constant location
with respect to the rest of the source code. If a <code>mkdep</code> utility
were to be distributed by Automake to compute dependencies when the installer
installs the software and not when the developer builds a source code
distribution, then it would be possible to allow the location of the header
files to be dynamic. If that development ever takes place in Automake,
Autotools will immediate follow. If you really don't like this,
then don't use this feature.

   <p>Usually, if you are installing one or two header files per library you
want them to be installed under <code>$(includedir)</code> and be includable
with
<pre class="example">     #include &lt;foo.h&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">On the other hand, there are many applications that install a lot of header
files, just for one library. In that case, you should put them under a
prefix and let them be included as:
<pre class="example">     #include &lt;prefix/foo.h&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Examples of libraries doing this X11 and Mesa.

   <p>This mechanism for tracking include files is most useful for very large
projects. You may not want to bother for simple homework-like throwaway
hacks. When a project starts to grow, it is very easy to switch.
