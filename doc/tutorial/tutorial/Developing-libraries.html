<h3 class="section">2.3 Developing libraries</h3>

<p>The key to better code is to focus away from developing
monolithic throw-away hacks that do only one job, and focus on developing
<dfn>libraries</dfn> (<strong>FIXME: crossreference</strong>). Break down the original
problem to parts, and the parts to smaller parts, until you get down to simple
subproblems that can be easily tested, and from which you can construct
solutions for both the original problem and future variants. Every library
that you write is a legacy that you can share with other developers, that
want to solve similar problems. Each library will allow these other developers
to focus on their problem and not have to reinvent the parts that are common
with your work from scratch. You should definetely make libraries out of
subproblems that are likely to be broadly useful. 
Please be very liberal in what you consider &ldquo;broadly useful&rdquo;. 
Please program in a defensive way that renders reusable as much code as
possible, regardless of whether or not you plan to reuse it in the near future. 
The final application should merely have to assemble all the libraries
together and make their functionality accessible to the user through a
good interface.

   <p>It is very important for each of your libraries to have a complete
<dfn>test suite</dfn>. The purpose of the test suite is to detect bugs
in the library and to prove to you or convince you, the developer, that the
library works. A test suite is composed of a collection of test programs
that link with your libraries and experiment with the features
provided by the library. These test programs should return with
<pre class="example">     exit(0);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">if they do not detect anything wrong with the library and with
<pre class="example">     exit(1);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">if they detect problems. The test programs should not be installed with
the rest of the package. They are meant to be run after your software
is compiled and before it is installed. Therefore, they should be written
so that they can run using the compiled but uninstalled files of the library. 
Test programs should not output messages by default. They should run
completely quietly and communicate with the environment in a yes or no
fashion using the <code>exit</code> code. However, it is useful for test programs
to output debugging information when they fail during development. Statements
that output such information should be surrounded by conditional
directives like this:
<pre class="example">     #if INSPECT_ERRORS
      printf("Division by zero: %d / %d\n",a,b);
     #endif
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This way it becomes easy to switch them on or off upon demand. The prefered
way to manipulate a macro like this <code>INSPECT_ERRORS</code> is by adding
a switch to your <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> script. You can do this by adding the
following lines to <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp>:
<pre class="example">     AC_ARG_WITH(inspect,
       [  --with-inspect           Inspect test suite errors],
       [ AC_DEFINE(INSPECT_ERRORS, 1, "Inspect test suite errors")],
       [ AC_DEFINE(INSPECT_ERRORS, 0, "Inspect test suite errors")])
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">After the
library is debugged, the debug statements should not be removed. If a
future version of the library regresses and an old test begins to fail
again, it will be useful to be able to reactivate the same error messages
that were useful in debugging the test when it was first put together,
and it may be necessary to add a few new ones.

   <p>The best time to write each test program is <em>as soon as it is possible!</em>. 
You should not be lazy, and you should not just keep throwing in code after
code after code. The minute there is enough code in there to put together some
kind of test program, <em>just do it!</em> When you write new code,
it is easy to think that you are producing work with every new line of code
that is written. The reality is that you <em>know</em> you have produced new
work
everytime you write working a test program for new features, and
<em>not a minute before</em>. 
Another time when you should definetely write a test program is when you
find a bug while ordinarily using the library. Then, write a test program
that triggers the bug, fix the bug, and keep the test in your test suite. 
This way, if a future modification reintroduces the same bug it will be
detected.

   <p>Please document your library as you go. The best time to update your
documentation is immediately after you get new test programs checking out new
futures. You might feel that you are too busy to write documentation, but
the truth of the matter is that you will <em>always</em> be too busy. 
In fact, if you are a busy person, you are likely to have many other
obligations bugging you around for your attention. There may be times that
you have to stay away from a project for a large amount of time. 
If you have consistently been maintaining documentation, it will help you
refocus on your project even after many months of absense.
