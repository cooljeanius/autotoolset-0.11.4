<p>The following notice refers to the Autotools package with which this
document is being distributed. 
The following notice refers to the Autotools package, which includes this
documentation, as well as the source code for utilities like <samp><span class="file">acmkdir</span></samp>
and for additional Autoconf macros. 
The complete GNU build system involves
other packages also, such as <dfn>Autoconf</dfn>, <dfn>Automake</dfn>,
<dfn>Libtool</dfn>
and a few other accessories. These packages are also free software, and you
can obtain them from the Free Software Foundation. For details on doing so,
please visit their web site <code>http://www.fsf.org/</code>. Although Autotools
has been designed to work with the GNU build system, it is not yet an
official part of the GNU project.

   <p>The Autotools package is &ldquo;free&rdquo;; this means that everyone is free to use
it and free to redistribute it on a free basis. The Autotools package is
 not in the public domain; it is copyrighted and there are restrictions
on its distribution, but these restrictions are designed to permit
everything that a good cooperating citizen would want to do. 
What is not allowed is to try to prevent others from further sharing
any version of this package that they might get from you.

   <p>Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give
away copies of the programs that relate to <dfn>Autotools</dfn>, that you receive
source code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change these
programs or use pieces of them in new free programs, and that you know
you can do these things.

   <p>To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
copies of the <dfn>Autotools</dfn>-related code, you must give the recipients all
the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or
can get the source code.  And you must tell them their rights.

   <p>Also,  for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone
finds out that there is no warranty for the programs that relate to
<dfn>Autotools</dfn>.  If these programs are modified by someone else and passed
on, we want their recipients to know that what they have is not what we
distributed, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect
on our reputation.

   <p>The precise conditions of the licenses for the programs currently
being distributed that relate to <dfn>Autotools</dfn> are found in the General
Public Licenses that accompany it.
