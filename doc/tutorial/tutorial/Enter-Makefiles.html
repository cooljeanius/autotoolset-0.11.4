<h3 class="section">4.2 Enter Makefiles</h3>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo; utility takes its instructions from a file called
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Makefile</span></samp>&rsquo; in the directory in which it was invoked. 
The <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> involves four concepts:
the <dfn>target</dfn>,
the <dfn>dependencies</dfn>, the <dfn>rules</dfn>, and the <dfn>source</dfn>. 
Before we illustrate these concepts with examples we will explain them
in abstract terms for those who are mathematically minded:
     <ul>
<li><dfn>Source</dfn> are the files that <em>you</em> wrote and which are present
when the distribution is unpacked. A source file has no dependencies, but
itself it may be a dependency to a target. 
<li><dfn>Target</dfn> is a file that you wish to generate from the source, or
an action that you wish to cause (called <dfn>phony</dfn> target since no
file by the name of the target is generated). 
For example when you type <samp><span class="file">make install</span></samp> you do not generate a
file called <samp><span class="file">install</span></samp>. What you generate is the action of moving
certain files in certain places. Generating the file or taking the action
is called <dfn>building</dfn> the target. A target may have dependencies and
it may itself be a dependency to another target. 
<li>A <dfn>Dependency</dfn> can be either a source file or a target. Either way,
a dependency is something that only targets <em>have</em>. Source files
do not have dependencies.

     <p>If the dependency is
a source file, then we say that, as a dependency to a certain target,
it is <dfn>up-to-date</dfn> if and only if the target's latest update happened
after the dependency's latest update. We say that the dependency <dfn>changed</dfn>
if and only if the target's latest update happened before the dependency's
latest update.

     <p>If the dependency itself is a target, then we define recursively
that as a dependency to a certain target, it has changed if and only if at
least one of its own dependencies has changed. A <dfn>phony</dfn> target is never
<dfn>up-to-date</dfn>. If a phony target is a dependency to another target, then
it will always cause that other target to be rebuilt. 
Okey, take a big breath and think about this a bit. 
<li><dfn>Rules</dfn> is a set of instructions that detail how to build a target
if the dependencies of that target have changed. These instructions
need to be issued if and only if at least one of the dependencies
has changed, and they must be issued only after the corresponding rules
for the dependencies that have changed are recursively invoked. 
You may want to take a big breath here as well. Note that this recursion
will be terminated only when it hits source files because they don't
have any dependencies. Then it will wrap itself back up and work from
bottom to top all the way to building the target at the top of the recursion. 
</ul>

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> is essentially a collection of <dfn>logical statements</dfn>
about these four concepts. The content of each statement in English is:
<blockquote>
To build this <dfn>target</dfn>, first make sure that these <dfn>dependencies</dfn>
are up to date. If not build them first in the order in which they
are listed. Then execute these <dfn>rules</dfn> to build <em>this</em> target. 
</blockquote>
   Given a complete collection of such statements it is possible to infer
what action needs to be taken to build a specific target, from the
source files and the current state of the distribution. By action we
mean passing commands to the shell. One reason why this is useful
is because if part of the building process does not need to be
repeated, it will not be repeated. The <samp><span class="file">make</span></samp> program will detect
that certain dependencies have not changed and skip the action
required for rebuilding their targets. Another reason why this approach is
useful is because it is intuitive in human terms. At least, it will
be intuitive when we illustrate it to you.

   <p>In make-speak each statement has the following form:
<pre class="example">     target: dependency1 dependency2 ....
            shell-command-1
            shell-command-2
            shell-command-3
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <code>target</code> is the name of the target and <code>dependency*</code> the
name of the dependencies, which can be either source files or other targets. 
The shell commands that follow are the commands
that need to be passed to the shell to build the target after the dependencies
have been built. To be compatible with most versions of make, you must
seperate these statements with a blank line. Also, the <code>shell-command*</code>
must be indented with the <kbd>tab</kbd> key. Don't forget your <kbd>tab</kbd> keys
otherwise <code>make</code> will not work.

   <p>When you run <code>make</code> you can pass the target that you want to build
as an argument. If you omit arguments and call <code>make</code> by itself then
the first target mentioned in the Makefile is the one that gets built. 
The makefiles that Automake generates have the phony target <code>all</code>
be the default target. That target will compile your code but not install it. 
They also provide a few more phony targets such as <code>install</code>,
<code>check</code>, <code>dist</code>, <code>distcheck</code>, <code>clean</code>, <code>distclean</code>
as we have discussed earlier. So Automake is saving you quite a lot of
work because without it you would have to write a lot of repetitive code
to provide all these phony targets.

   <p>To illustrate these concepts with an example suppose that you have this
situation:
     <ul>
<li>Four source files: <samp><span class="file">foo1.c</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">foo2.c</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">foo3.c</span></samp>,<samp><span class="file">foo4.c</span></samp>
<li>Three include files: <samp><span class="file">gleep1.h</span></samp>,<samp><span class="file">gleep2.h</span></samp>,<samp><span class="file">gleep3.h</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">foo1.c</span></samp> includes <samp><span class="file">gleep2.h</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">gleep3.h</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">foo2.c</span></samp> includes <samp><span class="file">gleep1.h</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">foo3.c</span></samp> includes <samp><span class="file">gleep1.h</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">gleep2.h</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="file">foo4.c</span></samp> includes <samp><span class="file">gleep3.h</span></samp>
</ul>
   To build an executable <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> you need to build object files and then
link them together. We say that the executable depends on the object files
and that each object file depends on a corresponding <samp><span class="file">*.c</span></samp> file
<em>and</em> the <samp><span class="file">*.h</span></samp> files that it includes. 
Then to get to an executable <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> you need to go through the following
dependencies:
<pre class="example">     foo: foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o foo4.o
     foo1.o: foo1.c gleep2.h gleep3.h
     foo2.o: foo2.c gleep1.h
     foo3.o: foo3.c gleep1.h gleep2.h
     foo4.o: foo4.c gleep3.h
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The thing on the left-hand-side is the target, the thing on the right-hand-side
is the dependencies. The logic is that to build the thing on the left, you
need to build the things on the right first. So, if <samp><span class="file">foo1.c</span></samp> changes,
<samp><span class="file">foo1.o</span></samp> must be rebuilt. If <samp><span class="file">gleep3.h</span></samp> changes then
<samp><span class="file">foo1.o</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">foo4.o</span></samp> must be rebuilt. That's the game.

   <p>The way the <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> actually looks like is like this:
<pre class="example">     foo: foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o foo4.o
             gcc foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o foo4.o -o foo
     
     foo1.o: foo1.c gleep2.h gleep3.h
             gcc -c foo1.c
     
     foo2.o: foo2.c gleep1.h
             gcc -c foo2.c
     
     foo3.o: foo3.c gleep1.h gleep2.h
             gcc -c foo3.c
     
     foo4.o: foo4.c gleep3.h
             gcc -c foo4.c
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">It's the same thing as before except that we have supplemented the <dfn>rules</dfn>
by which the target is built from the dependencies. 
Things to note about syntax:
     <ul>
<li>The rules must be indented with a <dfn>tab</dfn>. To get a tab you must press the
&lt;TAB&gt; key on your keyboard. 
<li>Each statement must be separated from the next statement with a blank line. 
<li>The first target is what gets built when you type simply
     <pre class="example">          % make
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Therefore, the target for the executable must go at the beginning. 
</ul>
   If you omit the tabs or the blank line, then the Makefile will not work. 
Some versions of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo; have relaxed the blank line rule, since it's
redundant, but to be portable, just put the damn blank line in.

   <p>You may ask, "how does &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo; know what I changed?". It knows because
<span class="sc">unix</span> keeps track of the exact date and time in which every file and
directory was modified. This is called the Unix <dfn>time-stamp</dfn>. What happens
then is that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo; checks
whether any of the dependencies is newer than the main target. If so, then
the target must be rebuilt. Cool. Now do the target's dependencies have
to be rebuilt? Let's look at <em>their</em> dependencies and find out! 
In this recursive fashion, the logic is untangled and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo; does
the Right Thing.

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">touch</span></samp>&rsquo; command allows you to <em>fake</em> time-stamps and make
a file look as if it has been just modified. This way you can force make
to rebuild everything by saying something like:
<pre class="example">     % touch *.c *.h
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you are building more than one executable, then you may want to
make a phony target <code>all</code> be the first target:
<pre class="example">     all: foo1 foo2 foo3
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Then calling <code>make</code> will attempt to build <code>all</code> and that will
cause make to loop over <samp><span class="file">foo1</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">foo2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">foo3</span></samp> and
get them built. Of course you can also tell make to build these individually
by typing:
<pre class="example">     % make foo1
     % make foo2
     % make foo3
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Anything that is a target can be an argument. You might even say
<pre class="example">     % make bar.o
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">if all you want is to build a certain object file and then stop.
