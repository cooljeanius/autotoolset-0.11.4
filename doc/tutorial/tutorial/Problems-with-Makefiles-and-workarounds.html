<h3 class="section">4.3 Problems with Makefiles and workarounds</h3>

<p>The main problem with maintaining Makefiles, in fact what we <em>mean</em> when
we complain about maintaining Makefiles, is keeping track of the dependencies. 
The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo; utility will do its job if you tell it what the dependencies
are, but it won't figure them out for you. There's a good reason for this
of course, and herein lies the wisdom of Unix. To figure out the dependencies,
you <em>need to know something about the syntax of the files that you
are working with!</em>. And <dfn>syntax</dfn> is the turf of the <dfn>compiler</dfn>, and
not &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The GNU compiler honors this responsibility and if you type:
<pre class="example">     % gcc -MM foo1.c
     % gcc -MM foo2.c
     % gcc -MM foo3.c
     % gcc -MM foo4.c
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">it will compute the dependencies and put them out in standard output. 
Even so, it is clear that something <em>else</em> is needed to take
advantage of this feature, if available, to generate a correct &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Makefile</span></samp>&rsquo;
automatically. This is the main problem for which the only work-around is
to use <em>another</em> tool that generates Makefiles.

   <p>The other big problem comes about with situations in which a software project
spans many subdirectories. Each subdirectory needs to have a Makefile,
and every Makefile must have a way to make sure that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo; gets called
recursively to handle the subdirectories. This can be done, but it is quite
cumbersome and annoying. Some programmers may choose to do without the
advantages of a well-organized directory tree for this reason.

   <p>There are a few other little problems, but they have for most part solutions
within the realm of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo; utility. One such problem is that if
you move to a system where the compiler is called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cc</span></samp>&rsquo; instead of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gcc</span></samp>&rsquo; you need to edit the Makefile everywhere. Here's a solution:
<pre class="example">     CC = gcc
     
     #CFLAGS = -Wall -g -O3
     CFLAGS = -Wall -g
     
     foo: foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o foo4.o
             $(CC) $(CFLAGS) foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o foo4.o -o foo
     
     foo1.o: foo1.c gleep2.h gleep3.h
             $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c foo1.c
     
     foo2.o: foo2.c gleep1.h
             $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c foo2.c
     
     foo3.o: foo3.c gleep1.h gleep2.h
             $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c foo3.c
     
     foo4.o: foo4.c gleep3.h
             $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c foo4.c
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Now the user just has to modify the first line where he defines the
<dfn>macro-variable</dfn> &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">CC</span></samp>&rsquo;, and whatever he puts there gets
substituted in the rules bellow. The other macro variable, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">CFLAGS</span></samp>&rsquo;
can be used to turn optimization on and off. Putting a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; mark in the
beginning of a line, makes the line a comment, and the line is ignored.

   <p>Another problem is that there is a lot of redundancy in this makefile. 
<em>Every object file is built from the source file the same way.</em>
Clearly there should be a way to take advantage of that right? 
Here it is:
<pre class="example">     CC = gcc
     CFLAGS = -Wall -g
     
     .SUFFIXES: .c .o
     
     .c.o:
             $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $&lt;
     
     .o:
             $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $&lt; -o $@
     
     foo: foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o foo4.o
     foo1.o: foo1.c gleep2.h gleep3.h
     foo2.o: foo2.c gleep1.h
     foo3.o: foo3.c gleep1.h gleep2.h
     foo4.o: foo4.c gleep3.h
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Now this is more abstract, and has some cool punctuation. The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">SUFFIXES</span></samp>&rsquo;
thing tells &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo; that files that are possible targets, fall under
three categories: files that end in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.c</span></samp>&rsquo;, files that end in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.o</span></samp>&rsquo;
and files that end in nothing. 
Now let's look at the next line:
<pre class="example">     .c.o:
             $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $&lt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This line is an <dfn>abstract</dfn> rule that tells &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo; how to make
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.o</span></samp>&rsquo; files from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.c</span></samp>&rsquo; files. The punctuation marks have the
following meanings:
     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>are the dependencies that changed causing the target to need to be rebuilt
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$@</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>is the target
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$^</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>are <em>all</em> the dependencies for the current rule
</dl>
   In the same spirit, the next rule tells how to make the executable file from
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.o</span></samp>&rsquo; files.
<pre class="example">     .o:
             $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $&lt; -o $@
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">All that has to follow the abstract rules is the dependencies,
<em>without</em> the specific rules! If you are using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gcc</span></samp>&rsquo; these
dependencies can be generated automatically and then you can <dfn>include</dfn> them
from your Makefile. Unfortunately
this approach doesn't work with all of the other compilers. And there is
no standard way to include another file into Makefile source. 
<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
Of course, what we will point out eventually is that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">automake</span></samp>&rsquo; can take
care of the dependencies for you.

   <p>The Makefile in our example can be enhanced in the following way:
<pre class="example">     CC = gcc
     CFLAGS = -Wall -g
     OBJECTS = foo1.o foo2.o foo3.o foo4.o
     PREFIX = /usr/local
     
     .SUFFIXES: .c .o
     
     .c.o:
             $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $&lt;
     
     .o:
             $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $&lt; -o $@
     
     foo: $(OBJECTS)
     foo1.o: foo1.c gleep2.h gleep3.h
     foo2.o: foo2.c gleep1.h
     foo3.o: foo3.c gleep1.h gleep2.h
     foo4.o: foo4.c gleep3.h
     
     clean:
             rm -f $(OBJECTS)
     
     distclean:
             rm -f $(OBJECTS) foo
     
     install:
             rm -f $(PREFIX)/bin/foo
             cp foo $(PREFIX)/bin/foo
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">We've added three fake targets called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">clean</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">distclean</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">install</span></samp>&rsquo; and introduced a few more macro-variables to control
redundancy. I am sure some bells are ringing now. When you type:
<pre class="example">     % make
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the first target (which is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo;) gets build, and your program compiles. 
When you type
<pre class="example">     % make install
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">since there is no file called <samp><span class="file">install</span></samp> anywhere, the rule there
is executed which has the effect of copying the executable over at
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/bin</span></samp>. To get rid of the object files,
<pre class="example">     % make clean
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and to get rid of the executable as well
<pre class="example">     % make distclean
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Such fake targets are called <dfn>phony targets</dfn> in makefile parlance. 
As you can see, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo; utility is quite powerful and there's a lot
it can do. If you want to become a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo; wizard, all you need to do
is read the <em>GNU Make Manual</em> and waste a lot of time spiffying up your
makefiles, instead of getting your programs debugged, The GNU Make manual
is extremely well written, and will make for enjoyable reading. It is also
<dfn>free</dfn>, unlike &ldquo;published&rdquo; books.

   <p>The reason we went to the trouble to explain &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo; is because it is
important to understand what happens behind the hood, and because in many
cases, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo; is a fine thing to use. It works for simple programs. 
And it works for many other things such as formatting TeX documents and
so on.

   <p>As we evolve to more and more complicated projects, there's two things that
we need. A more high-level way of specifying what you want to build, and
a way of automatically determining the values that you want to put to
things like <span class="sc">cflags</span>, <span class="sc">prefix</span> and so on. The first thing is what
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">automake</span></samp>&rsquo; does, the second thing is what &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">autoconf</span></samp>&rsquo; does.
