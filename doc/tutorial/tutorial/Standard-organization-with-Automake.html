<h3 class="section">5.5 Standard organization with Automake</h3>

<p>Now we get into the gory details of software organization. I'll tell you one
way to do it. This is advice, not divine will. It's simply a way that works
well in general, and a way that works well with <code>autoconf</code> and
<code>automake</code> in particular.

   <p>The first principle is to maintain the package of libraries seperate from
the package of applications. This is not an iron-clad rule. In software
engineering, where you have a crystal clear specification, it makes no
sense to keep these two seperate. I found from experience that it makes
a lot more sense in research. 
Either of these two packages must have a toplevel directory under which
live all of its guts. Now what do the guts look like?

   <p>First of all you have the traditional set of information files that
we described in Chapter 1:
<pre class="example">     README, AUTHORS, NEWS, ChangeLog, INSTALL, COPYING
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You also have the following subdirectories:
     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m4</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Here, you install any new &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m4</span></samp>&rsquo; files that your package may want
to install. These files define new &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">autoconf</span></samp>&rsquo; commands that you
may want to make available to other developers who want to use your
libraries. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">doc</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Here you put the documentation for your code. You have the creative freedom
to present the documentation in any way you desire. However, the prefered
way to document software is to use Texinfo. Texinfo has the advantage that
you can produce both on-line help as well as a nice printed book from the
same source. We will say something about Texinfo later. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">src</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Here's the source code. You could put it at the toplevel directory as
many developers do, but I find it more convenient to keep it away in
a subdirectory. Automake makes it trivially easy to do recursive
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo;, so there is no reason not to take advantage of it to keep
your files more organized. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">include</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This is an optional directory for distributions that use many libraries. 
You can have the <code>configure</code> script link all public header files
in all the subdirectories under <code>src</code> to this directory. This way
it will only be necessary to pass one <code>-I</code> flag to test suites that
want to access the include files of other libraries in the distribution. 
We will discuss this later. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lib</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This is an optional directory where you put portability-related
source code. This is mainly replacement implementations for system calls
that may not exist on some systems. You can also put tools here that you
commonly use accross many different packages, tools that are too simple
to just make libraries out of every each one of them. It is suggested
that you maintain these tools in a central place. 
We will discuss this much later. 
</dl>
   Together with these subdirectories you need to put a <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp>
and a <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp> file. I also suggest that you put a shell script,
which you can call <samp><span class="file">reconf</span></samp>, that contains the following:
<pre class="example">     #!/bin/sh
     rm -f config.cache
     rm -f acconfig.h
     touch acconfig.h
     aclocal -I m4
     autoconf
     autoheader
     acconfig
     automake -a
     exit
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This will generate <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp> and needs to
be called whenever you change a <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> or a <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp>
as well as when you change something under the <samp><span class="file">m4</span></samp> directory. 
It will also call <code>acconfig</code> which automatically generates
<code>acconfig.h</code> and calle &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">autoheader</span></samp>&rsquo; to make <code>config.h.in</code>. 
The <samp><span class="file">acconfig</span></samp> utility is part of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">autotools</span></samp>&rsquo;, and if you are
maintaining <samp><span class="file">acconfig.h</span></samp> by hand, then you want to use this script
instead:
<pre class="example">     #!/bin/sh
     rm -f config.cache
     aclocal -I m4
     autoconf
     autoheader
     automake -a
     exit
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">At the toplevel directory, you need to put a <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> that will
tell the computer that all the source code is under the <samp><span class="file">src</span></samp>
directory. The way to do it is to put the following lines in
<samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp>:
<pre class="example">     EXTRA_DIST = reconf
     SUBDIRS = m4 doc src
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">
     <ul>
<li>The first line tells <code>automake</code> that the <samp><span class="file">reconf</span></samp> script
is part of the distribution and must be included when you do <code>make dist</code>. 
<li>The second line tells <code>automake</code> that the rest of the distribution is
in the subdirectories <samp><span class="file">m4</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">doc</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">src</span></samp>. It instructs
<samp><span class="file">make</span></samp> to recursively call itself in these subdirectories. It is important
to include the <samp><span class="file">doc</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">m4</span></samp> subdirectories here and enhance them
with <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> so that <code>make dist</code> includes them into the
distribution. 
</ul>

   <p>If you are also using a <samp><span class="file">lib</span></samp> subdirectory, then it should be built
before <samp><span class="file">src</span></samp>:
<pre class="example">     EXTRA_DIST = reconf
     SUBDIRS = m4 doc lib src
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <samp><span class="file">lib</span></samp> subdirectory should build a static library that is linked
by your executables in <samp><span class="file">src</span></samp>. There should be no need to install that
library.

   <p>At the toplevel directory you also need to put the <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp>
file. That should look like this:
<pre class="example">     AC_INIT
     AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(packagename,versionnumber)
     [...put your tests here...]
     AC_OUTPUT(Makefile                   \
               doc/Makefile               \
               m4/Makefile                \
               src/Makefile               \
               src/dir1/Makefile          \
               src/dir2/Makefile          \
               src/dir3/Makefile          \
               src/dir1/foo1/Makefile     \
               ............               \
              )
     
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You will not need another <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp> file. However,
<strong>every directory level on your tree must have a </strong><samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp>. 
When you call
<code>automake</code> on the top-level directory, it looks at &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">AC_OUTPUT</span></samp>&rsquo; at
your
<samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp> to decide what other directories have a <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp>
that needs parsing. As you can see from above, a <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> file
is needed even under the <samp><span class="file">doc</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">m4</span></samp> directories. How to set
that up is up to you. If you aren't building anything, but just have files
and directories hanging around, you must declare these files and directories
in the <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> like this:
<pre class="example">     SUBDIRS = dir1 dir2 dir3
     EXTRA_DIST = file1 file2 file3
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Doing that will cause <code>make dist</code> to include these files and directories
to the package distribution.

   <p>This tedious setup work needs to be done everytime that you create a new
package. If you create enough packages to get sick of it, then you
want to look into the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">acmkdir</span></samp>&rsquo; utility that is distributed by
Autotools. We will describe it at the next chapter.
