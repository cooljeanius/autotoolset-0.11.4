<h3 class="section">5.2 OLD Using configuration headers</h3>

<p>As you may have noticed, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">configure</span></samp>&rsquo; script in the previous example
defines two preprocessor macros that you can use in your code:
<code>PACKAGE</code> and <code>VERSION</code>. As you become a power-user of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">autoconf</span></samp>&rsquo; you will get define even more such macros. If you inspect
the output of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo; during compilation, you will see that these macros
get defined by passing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-D</span></samp>&rsquo; flags to the compiler, one for each macro. 
When there is too many of these flags getting passed around, this can cause
two problems: it can make the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo; output hard to
read, and more importantly it can hit the buffer limits of various braindead
implementations of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo;. To work around this problem, an alternative
approach is to define all these macros in a special header file and include
it in all the sources.

   <p>A hello world program using this technique looks like this
     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp><dd>
     <pre class="example">          AC_INIT
          AM_CONFIG_HEADER(config.h)
          AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(hello,0.1)
          AC_PROG_CXX
          AC_PROG_INSTALL
          AC_OUTPUT(Makefile)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"><br><dt><samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp><dd>
     <pre class="example">          bin_PROGRAMS = hello
          hello_SOURCES = hello.c
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"><br><dt><samp><span class="file">hello.c</span></samp><dd>
     <pre class="example">          #ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
          #include &lt;config.h&gt;
          #endif
          
          #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
          main()
          {
           printf("Howdy, pardner!\n");
          }
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"></dl>
   Note that we call a new macro in <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp>:
<code>AM_CONFIG_HEADER</code>. Also we include the configuration file conditionally
with the following three lines:
<pre class="example">     #ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
     #include &lt;config.h&gt;
     #endif
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">It is important to make sure that the <samp><span class="file">config.h</span></samp> file is the first thing
that gets included. Now do the usual routine:
<pre class="example">     % aclocal
     % autoconf
     % touch NEWS README AUTHORS ChangeLog
     % automake -a
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Automake will give you an error message saying that it needs a file called
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">config.h.in</span></samp>&rsquo;. You can generate such a file with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">autoheader</span></samp>&rsquo;
program. So run:
<pre class="example">     % autoheader
     Symbol `PACKAGE' is not covered by acconfig.h
     Symbol `VERSION' is not covered by acconfig.h
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Again, you get error messages. The problem is that <code>autoheader</code> is
bundled with the <code>autoconf</code> distribution, not the <code>automake</code>
distribution, and consequently doesn't know how to deal with the
<code>PACKAGE</code> and <code>VERSION</code> macros. Of course, if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">configure</span></samp>&rsquo;
defines a macro, there's nothing to know. On the other hand, when a macro
<em>is not defined</em> then there are at least two possible defaults:
<pre class="example">     #undef PACKAGE
     #define PACKAGE 0
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <code>autoheader</code> program here complains that it doesn't know the defaults
for the <code>PACKAGE</code> and <code>VERSION</code> macros. To provide the defaults,
create a new file <samp><span class="file">acconfig.h</span></samp>:
     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="file">acconfig.h</span></samp><dd>
     <pre class="example">          #undef PACKAGE
          #undef VERSION
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"></dl>
   and run &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">autoheader</span></samp>&rsquo; again:
<pre class="example">     % autoheader
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">At this point you must run <code>autoconf</code> again, so that it takes into account
the presense of <code>acconfig.h</code>:
<pre class="example">     % aclocal
     % autoconf
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Now you can go ahead and build the program:
<pre class="example">     % configure
     % make
     Computing dependencies for hello.cc...
     echo &gt; .deps/.P
     gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.   -g -O2 -c hello.cc
     gcc -g -O2  -o hello  hello.o
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that now instead of multiple <code>-D</code> flags, there is only one
such flag passed: <code>-DHAVE_CONFIG_H</code>. Also, appropriate <code>-I</code>
flags are passed to make sure that <samp><span class="file">hello.cc</span></samp> can find and include
<samp><span class="file">config.h</span></samp>. 
To test the distribution, type:
<pre class="example">     % make distcheck
     ......
     ========================
     hello-0.1.tar.gz is ready for distribution
     ========================
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and it should all work out.

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">config.h</span></samp> files go a long way back in history. In the past, there
used to be packages where you would have to manually edit <samp><span class="file">config.h</span></samp>
files and adjust the macros you wanted defined by hand. This made these
packages very difficult to install because they required intimate knowledge
of your operating system. For example, it was not unusual to see a comment
saying <em>&ldquo;if your system has a broken vfork, then define this macro&rdquo;</em>. 
How the hell are you supposed to know if your systems <code>vfork</code> is
broken?? With auto-configuring packages all of these details are taken
care of automatically, shifting the burden from the user to the developer
where it belongs.

   <p>Normally in the <samp><span class="file">acconfig.h</span></samp> file you put statements like
<pre class="example">     #undef MACRO
     #define MACRO default
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">These values are copied over to <samp><span class="file">config.h.in</span></samp> and are supplemented with
additional defaults for C preprocessor macros that get defined by
native <code>autoconf</code> macros like
<code>AC_CHECK_HEADERS</code>, <code>AC_CHECK_FUNCS</code>, <code>AC_CHECK_SIZEOF</code>,
<code>AC_CHECK_LIB</code>.

   <p>If the file <samp><span class="file">acconfig.h</span></samp> contains the string <code>@TOP@</code> then all
the lines before the string will be included verbatim to <samp><span class="file">config.h</span></samp>
<em>before</em> the custom definitions. Also, if the file <samp><span class="file">acconfig.h</span></samp>
contains the string <code>@BOTTOM@</code> then all the lines after the string will
be included verbatim to <samp><span class="file">config.h</span></samp> <em>after</em> the custom definitions. 
This allows you to include further preprocessor directives that are related
to configuration. Some of these directives may be using the custom definitions
to conditionally issue further preprocessor directives. Due to a bug in
some versions of <code>autoheader</code> if the strings <code>@TOP@</code> and
<code>@BOTTOM@</code> do appear in your <code>acconfig.h</code> file, then you must
make sure that there is at least one line appearing before
<code>@TOP@</code> and one line after <code>@BOTTOM@</code>, even if it has to be
a comment. Otherwise, <code>autoheader</code> may not work correctly.

   <p>With &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">autotools</span></samp>&rsquo; we distribute a utility called <samp><span class="file">acconfig</span></samp> which
will build <samp><span class="file">acconfig.h</span></samp> automatically. By default it will always
make sure that
<pre class="example">     #undef PACKAGE
     #undef VERSION
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">are there. Additionally, if you install macros that are <samp><span class="file">acconfig</span></samp> friendly
then &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">acconfig</span></samp>&rsquo; will also install entries for these macros. 
The <code>acconfig</code> program may be revised in the future and perhaps
it might be eliminated. There is an unofficial patch to Autoconf that
will automate the maintance of <samp><span class="file">acconfig.h</span></samp>, eliminating the need
for a seperate program. I am not yet certain if that patch will be
part of the official next version of Autoconf, but I very much expect it
to. Until then, if you are interested, see:
<code>http://www.clark.net/pub/dickey/autoconf/autoconf.html</code>
This situation creates a bit of a dilemma about whether I should
document and encourage <code>acconfig</code> in this tutorial or not. 
I believe that the Autoconf patch is a superior solution. However since
I am not the one maintaining Autoconf, my hands are tied. For now
let's say that if you confine yourself to using only the macros provided
by <code>autoconf</code>, <code>automake</code>, and <code>autotools</code> then
<samp><span class="file">acconfig.h</span></samp> will be completely taken care for you by <samp><span class="file">acconfig</span></samp>. 
In the future, I hope that <code>acconfig.h</code> will be generated
by <code>configure</code> and be the sole responsibility of Autoconf.

   <p>You may be wondering whether it is worth using <samp><span class="file">config.h</span></samp> files in the
programs you develop if there aren't all that many macros being defined. 
My personal recommendation is <em>yes</em>. Use <samp><span class="file">config.h</span></samp> files because
perhaps in the future your <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> might need to define even more
macros. So get started on the right foot from the beginning. Also, it is
nice to just have a <code>config.h</code> file lying around because you can have
all your configuration specific C preprocessor directives in one place. 
In fact, if you are one of these people writing peculiar system software
where you get to <code>#include</code> 20 header files on every single source file
you write, you can just have them on all thrown into <code>config.h</code> once
and for all. 
In the next chapter we will tell you about the <code>LF</code> macros that get
distributed with <code>autotools</code> and this tutorial. These macros do require
you to use the <samp><span class="file">config.h</span></samp> file. The bottom line is: <samp><span class="file">config.h</span></samp>
is your friend; trust the <code>config.h</code>.
