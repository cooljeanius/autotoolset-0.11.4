<h3 class="section">1.6 Maintaining the documentation files</h3>

<p>Every software project must have its own directory. A minimal &ldquo;project&rdquo;
is the example that we described in <a href="Hello-world-example.html#Hello-world-example">Hello world example</a>. In general,
even a minimal project must have the files:
<pre class="example">     README, INSTALL, AUTHORS, THANKS, NEWS, ChangeLog
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Before distributing your source code, it
is important to write the real contents of these files. 
In this section we give a summary overview
on how these files should be maintained. For more details, please see
the <em>GNU coding standards</em> as published by the FSF.

     <ul>
<li><strong>The README file:</strong>
Every distribution must contain this file. This is the file that the
installer must read <em>fully</em> after unpacking the distribution and
before configuring it. You should briefly explain the purpose of the
distribution, and reference all other documentation available. Instructions
for installing the package normally belong in the <samp><span class="file">INSTALL</span></samp> file. 
However if you have something that you feel the installer <em>should</em>
know then mention it in this file. 
<li><strong>The INSTALL file:</strong>
Because the GNU installation procedure is streamlined, a standard
<samp><span class="file">INSTALL</span></samp> file will be created for you automatically by <code>Automake</code>. 
If you have something very important to say, it may be best to say it in
the <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> file instead. the <samp><span class="file">INSTALL</span></samp> file is mostly for
the benefit of people who've never installed a GNU package before. 
However, if your package is very unusual, you may decide that it is
best to modify the standard INSTALL file or write your own. 
<li><strong>The AUTHORS file:</strong>
If you maintain a package for the Free Software Foundation, then this file
should collect a fairly exact copy of the trace, normally kept in file
<samp><span class="file">/gd/gnuorg/assignments</span></samp> on the FSF machines, for all legal paper
exchanges between contributors and the GNU project. The file might have
an introductor blurb similar to this one:
     <pre class="example">          Authors of PACKAGE
          
          The following contributions warranted legal paper exchanges
          with the Free Software Foundation. Also see files ChangeLog
          and THANKS
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">If you do not maintain the project, then you should do the legal paperwork
yourself and record it here. If you choose not to do the paperwork, then
you should still list who the contributors are and what files they
have worked on. When you list the files, indicate whether they created
the file or whether they modified it. For example:
     <pre class="example">          Random J. Hacker:
            entire files  -&gt; foo1.c , foo2.c , foo3.c
            modifications -&gt; foo4.c , foo5.c
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"><li><strong>The THANKS file:</strong>
All distributions should contain a <samp><span class="file">THANKS</span></samp> file containing
a two column list of the contributors, one per line, alphabetically
sorted. The left column gives the contributor's name, while the right
column gives the last known good email address for this contributor. 
This list should be introduced with a wording similar to this one:
     <pre class="example">          PACKAGE THANKS file
          
          PACKAGE has originally been written by ORIGINAL AUTHOR. Many
          people further contributed to PACKAGE by reporting problems,
          suggesting various improvements or submitting actual code.
          Here is a list of these people. Help me keep it complete and
          exempt of errors.
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">The easiest policy with this file is to thank everyone who contributes
to the project, without judging the value of the contribution.

     <p>Unlike <samp><span class="file">AUTHORS</span></samp>, the <samp><span class="file">THANKS</span></samp> file is not maintained for
legal reasons. It is maintained to thank all the contributors that
helped you out in your project. The <samp><span class="file">AUTHORS</span></samp> file can not be
used for this purpose because certain contributions, like bug reports
or ideas and suggestions do not require legal paper exchanges.

     <p>You can also decide to send some kind of special greeting when you
initially add a name to your <samp><span class="file">THANKS</span></samp> file. The mere presense
of a name in <samp><span class="file">THANKS</span></samp> is then a flag to you that the initial
greeting has been sent. 
<li><strong>The NEWS file:</strong>
This is where you tell the users about the major features of this
distribution. You needn't go into details, but you do need to list
all the major features. The GNU coding standards explain in more detail
how to structure this file. 
<li><strong>The ChangeLog file</strong>:
Use this file to record all the changes that you make to your source code. 
If your source code is distributed among many subdirectories, and there
is reason enough to think of the contents of the subdirectories as
different subpackages,then please maintain
a separate <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> file for each subdirectory. For example,
although there is usually no need to maintain a <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> for
your documentation, if you do decide to maintain one anyway, it should be
separate from your sources <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>.

     <p>The <em>GNU coding standards</em> explain in a lot of detail how you should
structure a <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>, so you should read about it there. 
The basic idea is to record <em>semi-permenant modifications</em> you make to
your source code. It is not necessary to continuously record changes
that you make while you are experimenting with something. But once you
decide that you got a modification worked out, then you should record
Please do record version releases on the central <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>
(see <a href="Tracking-version-numbers.html#Tracking-version-numbers">Tracking version numbers</a>). 
This way, it will be possible to tell what changes happened between
versions.

     <p>You can automate <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> maintance with
Emacs using the <code>M-x add-change-log-entry-other-window</code>. It may be
easier to bind a key (for example <kbd>f8</kbd>) to this command by adding:
     <pre class="example">          (global-set-key [f8] 'add-change-log-entry-other-window)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">to your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file. Then, after having made a modification and
<em>while</em> the cursor is still at the place where you made the modification,
press <kbd>f8</kbd> and record your entry. 
Recently Emacs has decided to use
the ISO 8601 standard for dates which is: <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> (year-month-date). 
A typical <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> entry looks like this:
     <pre class="example">          1998-05-17  Eleftherios Gkioulekas  &lt;lf@amath.washington.edu&gt;
          
           * src/acmkdir.sh: Now acmkdir will put better default content
             to the files README, NEWS, AUTHORS, THANKS
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Every entry contains all the changes you made within the period of a day. 
The most recent changes
are listed at the top, the older changes slowly scroll to the bottom. 
<li><strong>COPYING</strong>
This file contains the copyright permissions for your distribution,
in particular the General Public License. 
This file will be generated for you automatically. 
Copyright is a very important concern in the free software community.

<strong>FIXME: CROSSREFERENCE DISCUSSION OF COPYRIGHT IN NEXT CHAPTER</strong>
</ul>

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">acmkdir</span></samp>&rsquo; utility will automatically create templates for these
files that you can start from.
