<h3 class="section">4.4 Building libraries</h3>

<p>There's one last thing that we need to mention before moving on, and that's
<dfn>libraries</dfn>. As you recall, to put together an executable, we make
a whole bunch of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.o</span></samp>&rsquo; files and then put them all together. It just
so happens in many cases that a set of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.o</span></samp>&rsquo; files together forms a
cohesive unit that can be reused in many applications, and you'd like
to use them in other programs. To make things simpler, what you do is put
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.o</span></samp>&rsquo; files together and make a <dfn>library</dfn>.

   <p>A library is usually composed of many &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.c</span></samp>&rsquo; files and hopefully only
one or at most two &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.h</span></samp>&rsquo; files. It's a good practice to minimize the
use of header files and put all your gunk in one header file, because this
way the user of your library won't have to be typing an endless stream
of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#include</span></samp>&rsquo; directives for <em>every</em> &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.c</span></samp>&rsquo; file he writes that
depends on the library. Be considerate. The user might be you! Header files
fall under two categories: <dfn>public</dfn> and <dfn>private</dfn>. The public
header files must be installed at <samp><span class="file">/prefix/include</span></samp> whereas the private
ones are only meant to be used internally. The public header files export
documented library features to the user. The private header files export
undocumented library features that are to be used only by the developer of
the library and only for the purpose of developing the library.

   <p>Suppose that we have a library called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">barf</span></samp>&rsquo; that's made of the following
files:
<blockquote>
<samp><span class="file">barf.h</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">barf1.c</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">barf2.c</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">barf3.c</span></samp>
</blockquote>
   In real life, the names should be more meaningful than that, but we're being
general here. To build it, you first make the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.o</span></samp>&rsquo; files:
<pre class="example">     % gcc -c barf1.c
     % gcc -c barf2.c
     % gcc -c barf3.c
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and then you do this magic:
<pre class="example">     % rm -f libbarf.a
     % ar cru libbarf.a barf1.o barf2.o barf3.o
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This will create a file <code>libbarf.a</code> from the object files
<samp><span class="file">barf1.o</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">barf2.o</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">barf3.p</span></samp>. 
On most Unix systems, the library won't work unless it's "blessed" by a
program called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ranlib</span></samp>&rsquo;:
<pre class="example">     % ranlib libbarf.a
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">On other Unix systems, you might find that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ranlib</span></samp>&rsquo; doesn't even exist
because it's not needed.

   <p>The reason for this is historical. Originally <code>ar</code>
was meant to be used merely for packaging files together. The more
well known program <code>tar</code> is a descendent of <code>ar</code> that was designed
to handle making such archives on a tape device. Now that tape devices are
more or less obsolete, <code>tar</code> is playing the role that was originally
meant for <code>ar</code>. As for <code>ar</code>, way back, some people thought to
use it to package <code>*.o</code> files. However the linker wanted a symbol table
to be passed along with the archive for the convenience of the people writing
the code for the linker. Perhaps also for efficiency. So the <code>ranlib</code>
program was written to generate that table and add it to the <code>*.a</code> file. 
Then some Unix vendors thought that if they incorporated <code>ranlib</code>
to <code>ar</code> then users wouldn't have to worry about forgetting to call
<code>ranlib</code>. So they provided <code>ranlib</code> but it did nothing. Some
of the more evil ones dropped it all-together breaking many people's
makefiles that tried to run <code>ranlib</code>. In the next chapter we will
show you that Autoconf and Automake will automatically determine for you
how to deal with <code>ranlib</code> in a portable manner.

   <p>Anyway, once you have a library, you put the header file <samp><span class="file">barf.h</span></samp> under
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/include</span></samp> and the <samp><span class="file">libbarf.a</span></samp> file under
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/lib</span></samp>. If you are in development phase, you put them
somewhere else, under a prefix different other than <samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp>.

   <p>Now, how do we use libraries? Well, suppose that a program uses the
<code>barf</code> function defined in the barf library. Then a typical program
might look like:
<pre class="example">     // -* main.c *-
     #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
     #include &lt;barf.h&gt;
     main()
     {
      printf("This is barf!\n");
      barf();
      printf("Barf me!\n");
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the library was installed in <samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp> then you can compile like
this:
<pre class="example">     % gcc -c main.c
     % gcc main.o -o main -lbarf
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Of course, if you did not install in <samp><span class="file">/prefix</span></samp> instead of
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">/usr</span></samp>
then you are in trouble. Now you have to do it this way:
<pre class="example">     % gcc -I/prefix/include -c main.c
     % gcc main.o -o main -L/prefix/lib -lbarf
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-I</span></samp>&rsquo; flag tells the compiler where to find any extra header files
(like <samp><span class="file">barf.h</span></samp>) and the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-L</span></samp>&rsquo; flag tells the compiler where to
find any extra libraries (like <samp><span class="file">libbarf.a</span></samp>). The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-lbarf</span></samp>&rsquo; flag
tells the compiler to bring in the entire <samp><span class="file">libbarf.a</span></samp> library with all
its enclosed
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.o</span></samp>&rsquo; files and link it in with whathaveyou to produce the executable.

   <p>If the library hasn't been installed yet, and is present in the same directory
as the object file <samp><span class="file">main.o</span></samp> then you can link them by passing its
filename instead:
<pre class="example">     % gcc main.o libbarf.a -o main
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Please link libraries with their full names if they haven't yet been
installed under the prefix directory and reserve using the <code>-l</code>
flag only for libraries that have already been installed. This is very
important. When you use Automake it helps it keep the dependencies straight. 
And when you use shared libraries, it is absolutely essential.

   <p>Also, please pay attention to the order with which you link your libraries. 
When the linker links a library, it does not embed into the executable code
the entire library, but only the symbols that are needed from the library. 
In order for the linker to know what symbols are really needed from any
given library, it must have already parsed all the other libraries and
object files that depend on that library! This implies that you
first link your object files, then you link the higher-level libraries,
then the lower-level libraries. If you are the author of the libraries,
you must write your libraries in such a manner, that the dependency graph
of your libraries is a tree. If two libraries depend on each other
bidirectionally, then you may have trouble linking them in. This suggests that
they should be one library instead!

   <p>While we are at the topic, when you compile ordinary programs like the
hello world program what really goes on behind the scenes is this:
<pre class="example">     % gcc -c hello.c
     % gcc -o hello hello.o -lc
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This links in the C system library <samp><span class="file">libc.a</span></samp>. 
The standard include files
that you use, such as <samp><span class="file">stdio.h</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">stdlib.h</span></samp> and whathaveyou
are all refering to various parts of these libraries. These libraries
get linked in by default when the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-o</span></samp>&rsquo; flag is present. Note that
other C compilers may be calling their system libraries something else. 
For this reason the corresponding flags are assumed and you don't have to
supply them.

   <p>The catch is that there are many functions that you think of as standard
that are not included in the <samp><span class="file">libc.a</span></samp> library. For example all the
math functions that are declared in <samp><span class="file">math.h</span></samp> are defined in
a library called <samp><span class="file">libm.a</span></samp> which is not linked by default. So
if the hello world program needed the math library you should be
doing this instead:
<pre class="example">     % gcc -c hello.c
     % gcc -o hello hello.o -lm
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">On some old Linux systems it used to be required that you also link
a <samp><span class="file">libieee.a</span></samp> library:
<pre class="example">     % gcc -o hello hello.o -lieee -lm
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">More problems of this sort occur when you use more esoteric system
calls like sockets. Some systems require you to link in additional
system libraries such as <samp><span class="file">libbsd.a</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">libsocket.a</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">libnsl.a</span></samp>. Also if you are linking Fortran and C code together
you must also link the Fortran run-time libraries. These libraries
have non-standard names and depend on the Fortran compiler you use. 
Finally, a very common problem is encountered when you are writing
X applications. The X libraries and header files like to be placed in
non-standard locations so you must provide system-dependent <code>-I</code>
and <code>-L</code> flags so that the compiler can find them. Also the most
recent version of X requires you to link in some additional libraries
on top of <code>libX11.a</code> and some rare systems require you to link
some additional system libraries to access networking features
(recall that X is built on top of the sockets interface and it is essentially a
communications protocol between the computer running the program and
computer that controls the screen in which the X program is displayed.) 
Fortunately, Autoconf can help you deal with all of this. We will cover
these issues in more detail in subsequent chapters.

   <p>Because it is necessary to link system libraries to form an executable,
under copyright law, the executable is derived work from the system libraries. 
This means that you must pay attention to the license terms of these libraries. 
The GNU <samp><span class="file">libc</span></samp> library is under the LGPL license which allows you to
link and distribute both free and proprietary executables. The <samp><span class="file">stdc++</span></samp>
library is also under terms that permit the distribution of proprietary
executables. The <samp><span class="file">libg++</span></samp> library however only permits you to build
free executables. If you are on a GNU system, including Linux-based GNU
systems, the legalese is pretty straightforward. If you are on a proprietary
Unix system, you need to be more careful. The GNU GPL does not allow
GPLed code to be linked against proprietary library. Because on Unix systems,
the system libraries are proprietary, their terms may not allow you to
distribute executables derived from them. In practice, they do however,
since proprietary Unix systems do want to attract proprietary applications. 
In the same spirit, the GNU GPL also makes an exception and explicitly
permits the linking of GPL code with proprietary system libraries, provided
that said libraries <em>are</em> system libraries. This includes
proprietary <samp><span class="file">libc.a</span></samp> libraries, the <samp><span class="file">libdxml.a</span></samp> library in
Digital Unix, proprietary Fortran system libraries like <samp><span class="file">libUfor.a</span></samp>,
and the X11 libraries.
