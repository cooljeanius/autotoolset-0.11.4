<h3 class="section">1.1 Installing a GNU package</h3>

<p>When you download an autoconfiguring package , it usually has a filename like:
<samp><span class="file">foo-1.0.tar.gz</span></samp> where the number is a <dfn>version number</dfn>. 
To install it, first you have to unpack the
package to a directory someplace:
<pre class="example">     % gunzip foo-1.0.tar.gz
     % tar xf foo-1.0.tar
</pre>
   <p>Then you enter the directory and look for files like <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="file">INSTALL</span></samp> that explain what you need to do. Almost always this amounts
to typing the following commands:
<pre class="example">     % cd foo-1.0
     % ./configure
     % make
     % make check
     % su
     # make install
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">configure</span></samp>&rsquo; command invokes a shell script that is distributed
with the package that configures the package for you automatically. 
First it probes your system through a set of tests that allow it to
determine things it needs to know, and then it uses this knowledge to
generate automatically a <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> from a template stored in a file
called <samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp>. When you invoke &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo; with no argument,
it executes the default target of the generated &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Makefile</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
That
target will compile your source code, but will not install it. 
If your software comes with self-tests then you can compile and run them by
typing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make check</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
To install
your software, you need to explicitly invoke &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo; again with
the target &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">install</span></samp>&rsquo;. In order for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo; to work, you must
make the directory where the <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> is located the current
directory.

   <p>During installation, the following files
go to the following places:
<pre class="example">     Executables   -&gt; /usr/local/bin
     Libraries     -&gt; /usr/local/lib
     Header files  -&gt; /usr/local/include
     Man pages     -&gt; /usr/local/man/man?
     Info files    -&gt; /usr/local/info
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; is the name of the package. 
The <samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp> directory is called the <dfn>prefix</dfn>. The default
prefix is always <samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp> but you can set it to anything you like
when you call &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">configure</span></samp>&rsquo; by adding a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--prefix</span></samp>&rsquo; option. 
For example, suppose that you are not a privilidged user, so you can not
install anything in <samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp>, but you would still like to install
the package for your own use. Then you can tell the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">configure</span></samp>&rsquo;
script to install the package in your home directory &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/home/username</span></samp>&rsquo;:
<pre class="example">     % ./configure --prefix=/home/username
     % make
     % make check
     % make install
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--prefix</span></samp>&rsquo; argument tells &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">configure</span></samp>&rsquo; where you want to
install your package, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">configure</span></samp>&rsquo; will take that into account and
build the proper makefile automatically.

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">configure</span></samp>&rsquo; script is compiled by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">autoconf</span></samp>&rsquo; from the contents
of a file called <samp><span class="file">configure.ac</span></samp>. These files are very easy to maintain,
and in this tutorial we will teach you how they work. The <samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp>
file is also compiled by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">automake</span></samp>&rsquo; from a very high-level specification
stored in a file called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Makefile.am</span></samp>&rsquo;. The developer then only needs
to maintain &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">configure.ac</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Makefile.am</span></samp>&rsquo;. As it turns out,
these are so much easier to work with than Makefiles and so much more
powerful, that you will find
that you will not want to go back to Makefiles ever again once you get
the hang of it.

   <p>In some packages, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">configure</span></samp>&rsquo; script supports many more options
than just &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--prefix</span></samp>&rsquo;. To find out about these options you should
consult the file <samp><span class="file">INSTALL</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> that are traditionally
distributed with the package, and also look at &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">configure</span></samp>&rsquo;'s self
documenting facility:
<pre class="example">     % configure --help
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Configure scripts can also report the version of Autoconf that generated
them:
<pre class="example">     % configure --version
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The makefiles generated by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">automake</span></samp>&rsquo; support a few more targets for
undoing the installation process to various levels. More specifically:
     <ul>
<li>If <code>configure</code> or <code>make</code> did it, <code>make distclean</code> undoes it. 
<li>If <code>make</code> did it, <code>make clean</code> undoes it. 
<li>If <code>make install</code> did it, <code>make uninstall</code> undoes it. 
</ul>

   <p>Also, in the spirit of free redistributable code, there are targets for
cutting a source code distribution. If you type
<pre class="example">     % make dist
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">it will rebuild the <samp><span class="file">foo-1.0.tar.gz</span></samp> file that you started with. 
If you modified the source, the modifications will be included in the
distribution (and you should probably change the version number). 
Before putting a distribution up on FTP, you can test its integrity
with:
<pre class="example">     % make distcheck
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This makes the distribution, then unpacks it in a temporary subdirectory
and tries to configure it, build it, run the test-suite, and check if the
installation script works. If everything is okey then you're told that
your distribution is ready.

   <p>Once you go through this tutorial, you'll have the know-how you need to
develop autoconfiguring programs with such powerful Makefiles.
