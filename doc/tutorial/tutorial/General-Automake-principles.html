<h3 class="section">5.7 General Automake principles</h3>

<p>In the previous section we described how to use Automake to compile
programs, libraries and test suites. To exploit the full power of Automake
however, it is important to understand the fundamental ideas behind it.

   <p>The simplest way to look at a <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> is as a collection of
assignments which infer a set of Makefile rules, which in turn infer the
building process. There are three types of such assignments:
     <ul>
<li><dfn>Global</dfn> assignments modify the behaviour of the entire Makefile for the
given subdirectory. Examples of such assignments are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">INCLUDES</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">LDADD</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">LDFLAGS</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">TESTS</span></samp>&rsquo;. These assignments affect the
behaviour of the Makefile in the given directory indepedent of what gets
built. In order for an assignment to be <dfn>global</dfn>, the name of the
variable to which you are assigning must have a special meaning to Automake. 
If it does not, then the assignment has no effect, but it may be used
as a variable in other assignments. 
<li><dfn>Primitive</dfn> assignments declare the primitives that we want to build. 
Such assignments are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bin_PROGRAMS</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lib_LIBRARIES</span></samp>&rsquo;, and others. 
The general pattern of these assignments is two words seperated by an
underscore. The second word is the type of the primitive being built, and
it affects what Makefile rules are generated for building the primitive. 
The first word contains information about where to install the primitive
once its built, so it affects the Makefile rules that handle the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">install</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">uninstall</span></samp>&rsquo; targets. The way this works is that
for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bin</span></samp>&rsquo; there corresponds a global assignment for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bindir</span></samp>&rsquo;
containing the installation directory. For example the symbols &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bin</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lib</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">include</span></samp>&rsquo; have the following default assignments:
     <pre class="example">          bindir     = $(prefix)/bin
          libdir     = $(prefix)/lib
          includedir = $(prefix)/include
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">These are the directories where you install executables, libraries and
public header files. You can override the defaults by inserting different
assignments in your <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp>, but please don't do that. Instead
you can define new assignments. For example, if you do
     <pre class="example">          foodir = $(prefix)/foo
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">then that makes writing <samp><span class="file">foo_PROGRAMS</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">foo_LIBRARIES</span></samp> install
in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(prefix)/foo</span></samp>&rsquo; direcory instead. 
The symbols &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">check</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">noinst</span></samp>&rsquo; have special meanings and you
should not ever try to assign to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">checkdir</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">noinstdir</span></samp>&rsquo;.
          <ul>
<li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">check</span></samp>&rsquo; symbol, suggests that the primitive should only be
built when the user invokes &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make check</span></samp>&rsquo; and it should not be installed. 
It is only meant to be executed as part of a test suite and then get scrapped. 
<li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">noinst</span></samp>&rsquo; symbol, suggests that the primitive should not be
installed. It will be built however normally, when you invoke &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
You could use this to build convenience libraries which you
intend to link in statically to executables which you do plan to install. 
You could also use this to build executables which will generate source
code that will subsequently be used to build something installable. 
</ul>
     <li><dfn>Property</dfn> assignments define the properties for every primitive that
you declare. A property is also made of two words that are seperated by
an underscore. The first word names the primitive to which the property
refers to. The second word names the name of the property itself. For
example when you define
     <pre class="example">          bin_PROGRAMS = hello
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">this means that you can then say:
     <pre class="example">          hello_SOURCES = ...
          hello_LDADD   = ...
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">and so on. The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">SOURCES</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">LDADD</span></samp>&rsquo; are properties of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hello</span></samp>&rsquo;
which is a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">PROGRAMS</span></samp>&rsquo; primitive. 
</ul>

   <p>In addition to all this, you may include ordinary targets in a
<samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> just as you would in an ordinary <samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp>. 
If you do that however, then please check at some point that your
distribution can properly build with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make distcheck</span></samp>&rsquo;. It is very
important that when you define your own rules, to build whatever
you want to build, to follow the following guidelines:
     <ul>
<li>Prepend all source files both in the dependencies and the rules with
<code>$(srcdir)</code>. This variable points to the directory where
your source code is located during the current &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo;, which is not
necessarily the same directory as the one returned by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">`pwd`</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
It is possible to do what is called a <dfn>VPATH build</dfn> where the generated
files are created in a seperate directory tree from the source code. 
What &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">`pwd`</span></samp>&rsquo; would return to you in that case would be the directory in
which files are <em>written</em>, not the directory from which files are
<em>read</em>. 
If you mess this up, then you will know when
<code>make distcheck</code> fails, which attempts to do a VPATH build. The
directory in which files are written can be accessed by the dot. 
For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">./foo</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
<li>If you need to get to any files from the top-level directory use
<code>$(top_srcdir)</code> for files which <em>you</em> wrote (and your compiler
tools <em>read</em>) and
<code>$(top_builddir)</code> for files which <em>the compiler</em> wrote. 
<li>For your rules use only the following commands directly:
     <pre class="example">          ar cat chmod cmp cp diff echo egrep expr false grep ls
          mkdir mv pwd rm rmdir sed sleep sort tar test touch true
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Any other programs that you want to use, you must do so through make variables. 
That includes programs such as these:
     <pre class="example">          awk bash bison cc flex install latex ld ldconfig lex ln make
          makeinfo perl ranlib shar texi2dvi yacc
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">The make variables you define through Autoconf in your <code>configure.in</code>. 
For special-purpose tools, use the AC_PATH_PROGS macro. For example:
     <pre class="example">          AC_PATH_PROGS(BASH, bash sh)
          AC_PATH_PROGS(PERL, perl perl5.005 perl5.004 perl5.003 perl5.002 perl5.001)
          AC_PATH_PROGS(SHAR, shar)
          AC_PATH_PROGS(BISON, bison)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Some special tools have their own macros:
     <pre class="example">          AC_PROG_MAKE_SET -&gt; $(MAKE)   -&gt; make
          AC_PROG_RANLIB   -&gt; $(RANLIB) -&gt; ranlib | (do-nothing)
          AC_PROG_AWK      -&gt; $(AWK)    -&gt; mawk | gawk | nawk | awk
          AC_PROG_LEX      -&gt; $(LEX)    -&gt; flex | lex
          AC_PROG_YACC     -&gt; $(YACC)   -&gt; 'bison -y' | byacc | yacc
          AC_PROG_LN_S     -&gt; $(LN_S)   -&gt; ln -s
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Before using any of these macros, consult the Autoconf documentation to see
exactly what it is that they do. 
</ul>
