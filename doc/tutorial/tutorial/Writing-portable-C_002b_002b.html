<h3 class="section">6.4 Writing portable C++</h3>

<p>The C++ language has been standardized very recently. As a result, not all
compilers fully support all the features that the ANSI C++ standard requires,
including the <code>g++</code> compiler itself. Some of the problems commonly
encountered, such as incorrect scoping in for-loops and lack of the
<code>bool</code> data type can be easily worked around. In this section we
give some tips for avoiding more portability problems. I welcome people on
the net reading this to email me their tips, to be included in this
tutorial.
     <ul>
<li>The following code, as much as it may seem reasonable is not correct:
     <pre class="example">          int n = 10;
          double **foo;
          foo = new (double *)[i];
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">The <code>g++</code> compiler will parse this and do the right thing, but other
compilers are more picky. The correct way to do it is:
     <pre class="example">          int n = 10;
          double **foo;
          foo = new double * [i];
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"><li>Do not use exceptions, RTTI and STL. Yes, they can make your code more spiffy,
but almost certainly you can live without them, and save yourself serious
portability pains. 
<li>Do not use templates, unless it is absolutely necessary. If you believe it
is possible to implement an idea without templates, then do it without
templates. If you do need to use templates, try to limit the amount of
features you invoke to the absolute minimum. In particular:
          <ul>
<li>A class can have a template function as a member function. Unfortunately this
is not supported by <code>g++</code>. 
<li>Some people discovered that by using templates with types that are templates
of types that are templates of types that are templates .... recursively,
they can force the C++ compiler to do computation at compile time and generate
C++ code that is highly optimized. Problems in linear algebra, FFTs and such
have been implemented in this manner, and the performance of the corresponding
C++ code beat out Fortran implementations. This is a great idea of the future,
but at the moment many compilers, including g++ can't properly cope with
such code. For now don't make templates of templates of things. Only make
templates of things. 
</ul>
     </ul>

   <p>FIXME: <em>I need to add some stuff here.</em>
