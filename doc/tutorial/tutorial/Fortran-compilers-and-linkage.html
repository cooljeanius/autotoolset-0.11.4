<h3 class="section">8.2 Fortran compilers and linkage</h3>

<p>The traditional Hello world program in Fortran looks like this:
<pre class="example">     c....:++++++++++++++=
           PROGRAM MAIN
           PRINT*,'Hello World!'
           END
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">All lines that begin with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo; are comments. The first line is the
equivalent of <code>main()</code> in C. The second line says hello, and the
third line indicates the end of the code. It is important that all command
lines are indented by 7 spaces, otherwise the compiler will issue a syntax
error. Also, if you want to be ANSI compliant, you must write your code all
in caps. Nowadays most compilers don't care, but some may still do.

   <p>To compile this with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g77</span></samp>&rsquo; (or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f77</span></samp>&rsquo;) you do something like:
<pre class="example">     % g77 -o hello hello.f
     % hello
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">To compile it with the f2c translator:
<pre class="example">     % f2c hello.f
     % gcc -o hello hello.c -lf2c -lm
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-lf2c</span></samp>&rsquo; links in the translator's system library. 
In order for this to work, you will have to make sure that the header file
<code>f2c.h</code> is present since the translated code in <samp><span class="file">hello.c</span></samp> includes
it with a statement like
<pre class="example">     #include "f2c.h"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which explicitly requires it to be present in the current working directory.

   <p>In this case, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">main</span></samp>&rsquo; is written in Fortran. However most of the
Fortran you will be using will actually be subroutines and functions. 
A subroutine looks like this:
<pre class="example">     c....:++++++++++++++
           SUBROUTINE FHELLO (C)
           CHARACTER *(*) C
           PRINT*,'From Fortran: ',C
           RETURN
           END
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This is the analog of a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">void</span></samp>&rsquo; function in C, because it takes
arguments but doesn't return anything. The prototype declaration is
<dfn>K&amp;R</dfn> style: you list all the arguments in parenthesis, seperated with
commas, and you declare the types of the variables in the subsequent lines.

   <p>Suppose that this subroutine is saved as <samp><span class="file">fhello.f</span></samp>. To call it from
C you need to know what it looks like from the point of the C compiler. 
To find out type:
<pre class="example">     % f2c -P fhello.f
     % cat fhello.P
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You will find that this subroutine has the following prototype declaration:
<pre class="example">     extern int fhello_(char *c__, ftnlen c_len);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">It may come as a surprise, and this is a moment of revelation, but although
in Fortran it appears that the subroutine is taking <em>one</em> argument, in
C it appears that it takes <strong>two</strong>! And this is what makes
it difficult to link code in a portable manner between C and Fortran. In
C, everything is what it appears to be. If a function takes two arguments,
then this means that down to the machine language level, there is two
arguments that are being passed around. In Fortran, things are being hidden
from you and done in a magic fashion. The Fortran programmer thinks that he
is passing one argument, but the compiler compiles code that actually passes
two arguments around. In this particular case, the reason for this is that
the argument you are passing is a string. In Fortran, strings are not
null-terminated, so the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f2c</span></samp>&rsquo; compiler passes the length of the string
as an extra hidden argument. This is called the <dfn>linkage method</dfn> of the
compiler. Unfortunately, linkage in Fortran is not standard, and there
exist compilers that handle strings differently. For example, some compilers
will prepend the string with a few bytes containing the length and pass
a pointer to the whole thing. This problem is not limitted to strings. 
It happens in many other instances. 
The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f2c</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g77</span></samp>&rsquo; compilers follow compatible linkage, and
we will use this linkage as the <em>ad-hoc standard</em>. A few proprietary
Fortran compilers like the Dec Alpha &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f77</span></samp>&rsquo; and the Irix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f77</span></samp>&rsquo;
are also &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f2c</span></samp>&rsquo;-compatible. The reason for this is because most of
the compiler developers derived their code from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f2c</span></samp>&rsquo;. So although
a standard was not really intended, there we have one anyway.

   <p>A few things to note about the above prototype declaration is that the
symbol &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fhello</span></samp>&rsquo; is in lower-case, even though in Fortran we write
everything uppercase, and it is appended with an underscore. On some platforms,
the proprietary Fortran compiler deviates from the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f2c</span></samp>&rsquo; standard either
by forcing
the name to be in upper-case or by omitting the underscore. Fortunately,
these cases can be detected with Autoconf and can be worked around with
conditional compilation. However, beyond this, other portability problems,
such as the strings issue, are too involved to deal with and it is best
in these cases that you fall back to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f2c</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">g77</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
A final thing to note is that although &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fhello</span></samp>&rsquo; doesn't return anything,
it has return type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">int</span></samp>&rsquo; and not &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">void</span></samp>&rsquo;. The reason for this is
that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">int</span></samp>&rsquo; is the default return type for functions that are not
declared. Therefore, to prevent compilation problems, in case the user forgets
to declare a Fortran function, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f2c</span></samp>&rsquo; uses &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">int</span></samp>&rsquo; as the return
type for subroutines.

   <p>In Fortran parlance, a <dfn>subroutine</dfn> is what we'd call a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">void</span></samp>&rsquo;
function. To Fortran programmers in order for something to be a
<dfn>function</dfn> it has to return something back. This reflects on the syntax. 
For example, here's a function that adds two numbers and returns the
result:
<pre class="example">     c....:++++++++++++++++
           DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION ADD(A,B)
           DOUBLE PRECISION A,B
           ADD = A + B
           RETURN
           END
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The name of the function is also the name of the return variable. 
If you run this one through &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f2c -P</span></samp>&rsquo; you will find that the C prototype
is:
<pre class="example">     extern doublereal add_(doublereal *a, doublereal *b);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">There's plenty of things to note here:
     <ul>
<li>The typenames being used are funny. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">doublereal</span></samp>&rsquo;? what's that!? 
These are all defined in a header file called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f2c.h</span></samp>&rsquo; which you are
supposed to include in your source code before declaring any prototypes. 
We will show you how this is all done in the next section. The following
table showes the types that are most likely to interest you. For more info,
take a look at the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f2c.h</span></samp>&rsquo; file itself:
     <pre class="example">            integer         -&gt; int
            real            -&gt; float
            doublereal      -&gt; double
            complex         -&gt; struct { real r,i; };
            doublecomplex   -&gt; struct { doublereal r,i; };
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"><li>The arguments are passed by pointer. In Fortran all arguments are passed
by reference. The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f2c</span></samp>&rsquo; compiler implements this by passing the
arguments by pointer. On the C/C++ level you may want to wrap the fortran
routine with another routine so that you don't have to directly deal with
pointers all of the time. 
<li>The value returned now is not an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">int</span></samp>&rsquo; but &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">doublereal</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Of course, the name of the function is lower-case, as always, and
there is an underscore at the end. 
</ul>

   <p>A more interesting case is when we deal with complex numbers. Consider
a function that multiplies two complex numbers:
<pre class="example">     c....:++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
           COMPLEX*16 FUNCTION MULT(A,B)
           COMPLEX*16 A,B
           MULT = A*B
           RETURN
           END
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">As it turns out, the prototype for this function is:
<pre class="example">     extern Z_f mult_(doublecomplex *ret_val, doublecomplex *a, doublecomplex *b);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Because complex numbers are not a native type in C, they can not be returned
efficiently without going through at least one copy. Therefore, for this
special case the return value is placed as the first argument in the prototype! 
Actually despite many people's feelings that Fortran must die, it is still
the best tool to use to write optimized functions that are heavy on complex
arithmetic.
