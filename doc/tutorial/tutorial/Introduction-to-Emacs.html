<h3 class="section">3.1 Introduction to Emacs</h3>

<p>Emacs is an environment for running Lisp programs that manipulate text
interactively. Because Emacs is completely programmable, it can be used to
implement not only editors, but a full
<dfn>integrated development environment</dfn> for software development. Emacs can
also browse info documentation, run email clients, a newsgroup reader,
a sophisticated xterm, and an understanding psychotherapist.

   <p>Under the X window system, Emacs controls multiple x-windows
called <dfn>frames</dfn>. Each frame has a menubar and the main editing area. 
The editing area is divided into <dfn>windows</dfn> with horizontal bars. 
You can grab these bars and move them around with the first mouse button. 
<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
Each window is bound to a <dfn>buffer</dfn>. A buffer is an Emacs data structure
that contains text. Most editing commands operate on buffers, modifying
their contents. When a buffer is bound to a window, then you can see its
contents as they are being changed. It is possible for a buffer to be bound
to two windows, on different frames or on the same frame. Then whenever
a change is made to the buffer, it is reflected on both windows. It is
not necessary for a buffer to be bound to a window, in order to operate on
it. In a typical Emacs session you may be manipulating more buffers than
the windows that you have on your screen.

   <p>A buffer can be <dfn>visiting</dfn> files. In that case, the contents of the
buffer reflect the contents of a file that is being editted. But buffers
can be associated with anything you like, so long as you program
it up. For example, under the Dired directory editor, a buffer is bound
to a directory, showing you the contents of the directory. When you
press &lt;Enter&gt; while the cursor is over a file name, Emacs creates
a new buffer, visits the file, and rebinds the window with that buffer. 
From the user's perspective, by pressing &lt;Enter&gt; he &ldquo;opened&rdquo; the
file for editing. If the file has already been &ldquo;opened&rdquo; then Emacs
simply rebinds the existing buffer for that file.

   <p>Emacs uses a variant of LISP, called Emacs LISP, as its programming language. 
Everytime you press a key, click the mouse, or select an entry from the
menubar, an Emacs LISP function is evaluated. The <dfn>mode</dfn> of the
buffer determines, among many other things, what function to evaluate. 
This way, every buffer can be associated with functionality that defines
what you do in that buffer. For example you can program your buffer to edit
text, to edit source code, to read news, and so on. You can also run
LISP functions directly on the current buffer by typing <code>M-x</code> and
the name of the function that you want to run. 
<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>

   <p>What is known as the &ldquo;Emacs editor&rdquo; is the default implementation of
an editor under the Emacs system. If you prefer the vi editor, then you
can instead run a vi clone, Viper (see <a href="Using-vi-emulation.html#Using-vi-emulation">Using vi emulation</a>). 
The main reason why you should use Emacs, is not the particular editor,
but the way Emacs integrates editing with all the other functions that
you like to do as a software developer. For example:
     <ul>
<li>You can edit multiple files under one program. From the user
perspective, you can edit two different parts of a file under two different
x-windows. And when you revisit a file, the cursor is placed where it was
the last time you were editing the file. 
<li>You can quickly browse a directory and navigate from file to file. 
You can also do simple operations on files, without needing to go to
a shell. 
<li>You can transparently edit files over FTP. This is extremely valuable
if you are editing source code on a remote computer and you are connected
through a modem link. 
<li>You can have a running shell for typing unix commands, and access the same
shell from any Emacs frame. 
You can use that shell to run &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">reconf</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">configure</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo;. You can also save the contents of your session to a file. 
<li>Color is used to highlight syntactic information about the text. 
This makes browsing more pleasing to the eye, and it can also help you
catch syntactic mistakes. Emacs understands the syntax of most types
of files you are likely to edit and will color them up for you accordingly. 
<li>When you edit source code under Emacs, it will automatically be formatted
for you to conform to the GNU coding standards. At your request,
appropriate copyright notices can be inserted. 
(see <a href="Inserting-notices-with-Emacs.html#Inserting-notices-with-Emacs">Inserting notices with Emacs</a>)
<li>When you make changes to a file, Emacs can automatically warp you to the
appropriate <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> file to record your changes. It will
handle formatting details for you allowing you to focus on content. 
(see <a href="Maintaining-the-documentation-files.html#Maintaining-the-documentation-files">Maintaining the documentation files</a>)
<li>Emacs is invaluably helpful for writing Texinfo documentation. In fact,
it is excruciatingly painful to maintain Texinfo documentation without
using Emacs. 
(see <a href="GNU-Emacs-support-for-Texinfo.html#GNU-Emacs-support-for-Texinfo">GNU Emacs support for Texinfo</a>)
<li>You can run the <samp><span class="file">gdb</span></samp> debugger under Emacs and use it to step
through your code. As you do that, Emacs will show you on a separate buffer
the code that is currently being stepped through. 
<li>You can read email and newsgroups. If you are connected over a modem,
all your editing is done locally, so you do not get bogged down by the
speed of your connection. 
You can apply patches that you get through email or news
to your source code directly, without needing to save the message to a file. 
<li>Emacs currently supports almost every international language, even
languages that do not use the Roman alphabet, like Greek, Chinese, Hebrew,
Tibetan,etc. 
</ul>

   <p>All of these features make Emacs a very powerful, albeit unusual,
integrated development environment. 
Many users of proprietary operating
systems, like Lose95
<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>,
complain that GNU (and Unix) does not have an integrated development
environment. As a matter of fact it does. All of the above features make Emacs
a very powerful IDE.

   <p>Emacs has its own very extensive documentation
(see <a href="Further-reading-on-Emacs.html#Further-reading-on-Emacs">Further reading on Emacs</a>). In this manual we will only go over
the fundamentals for using Emacs effectively
as an integrated development environment.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> Note that in Emacs parlance a <dfn>window</dfn> is not an X window. 
A frame is an X window. A <dfn>window</dfn> is a region within the frame.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> M-x means <kbd>&lt;ALT&gt;-x</kbd>. If you do not have an &lt;ALT&gt; key,
then use <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; x</kbd> instead.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-3" href="#fnd-3">3</a>]</small> Many individuals refer to <dfn>Microsoft Windows 95</dfn> as Win95. 
In hacker terminology, a <dfn>win</dfn> is something that is good. We do not
believe that Microsoft Windows 95 is a good operating system, therefore
we call it Lose95</p>
