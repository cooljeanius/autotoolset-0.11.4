<h3 class="section">5.4 Some general advice</h3>

<p>In software engineering, people start from a precise, well-designed
specification and proceed to implementation. In research, the specification
is fluid and immaterial and the goal is to be able to solve a slightly
different problem every day. To have the flexibility to go from variation
to variation with the least amount of fuss is the name of the game. By fuss,
we refer to <dfn>debugging</dfn>,
<dfn>testing</dfn> and <dfn>validation</dfn>. Once you have a code that you know gives
the right
answer to a specific set of problems, you want to be able to move on to a
different set of similar problems with reinventing, debugging and testing
as little as possible. These are the two distinct situations that computer
programmers get to confront in their lives.

   <p>Software engineers can take good care of themselves in both situations. 
It's part of their training. However, people whose specialty is the scientific
problem and not software engineering, must confront the hardest of the two
cases,
the second one, with very little training in software engineering. 
As a result they develop code that's clumsy in implementation, clumsy in usage,
and with only redeeming quality the fact that it gives the right answer. 
This way, they do get the work of the day done, but they leave behind them
no legacy to do the work of tomorrow. No general-purpose tools, no
documentation, no reusable code.

   <p>The key to better software engineering is to focus away from developing
monolithic applications that do only one job, and focus on developing
libraries. One way to think of libraries is as a
<em>program with multiple entry points</em>. Every library you write becomes
a legacy that you can pass on to other developers. 
Just like in mathematics you develop
little theorems and use the little theorems to hide the complexity in
proving bigger theorems, in software engineering you develop libraries
to take care of low-level details once and for all so that they are
out of the way everytime you make a different implementation for
a variation of the problem.

   <p>On a higher level you still don't create just
one application. You create many little applications that work together. 
The centralized all-in-one approach in my experience is far less flexible
than the decentralized approach in which a set of applications work together
as a team to accomplish the goal. In fact this is the fundamental principle
behind the design of the Unix operating system. Of course, it is still
important to glue together the various components to do the job. This you
can do either with scripting or with actually building a suite of
specialized monolithic applications derived from the underlying tools.

   <p>The name of the game is like this:
Break down the program to parts. And the parts to smaller parts, until you
get down to simple subproblems that can be easily tested, and from which
you can construct variations of the original problem. Implement each one
of these as a library, write test code for each library and make sure that
the library works. It is very important for your library to have a complete
<dfn>test suite</dfn>, a collection of programs that are supposed to run silently
and return normally (<code>exit(0);</code>) if they execute successfully,
and return abnormally (<code>assert(false); exit(1);</code>) if they fail. 
The purpose of the test suite is to detect bugs in the library, and to
convince you, the developer, that the library works. The best time to
write a test program is <em>as soon as it is possible!</em> Don't be lazy. 
Don't just keep throwing in code after code after code. The minute there
is enough new code in there to put together some kind of test program,
<em>just do it!</em> I can not emphasize that enough. When you write new code
you have the illusion that you are producing work, only to find out tomorrow
that you need an entire week to debug it. As a rule, internalize the reality
that you <em>know</em> you have produced new work everytime you write a working
test program for the new features, and <em>not a minute before</em>. 
Another time when you should definetly write a test suite is when you
find a bug while ordinarily using the library. Then, before you even
fix the bug, write a test program that detects the bug. Then go fix it. 
This way, as you add new features to your libraries you have insurance that
they won't reawaken old bugs.

   <p>Please keep documentation up to date as you go. The best time to write
documentation
is right after you get a few new test programs working. You might feel that
you are too busy to write documentation, but the truth of the matter
is that you will <em>always</em> be too busy. After long hours debugging
these seg faults, think of it as a celebration of triumph to fire up the
editor and document your brand-spanking new cool features.

   <p>Please make sure that
computational code is completely seperated from I/O code so that someone
else can reuse your computational code without being forced to also follow
your I/O model. Then write <em>programs</em> that invoke your collection
of libraries to solve various problems. By dividing and conquering the
problem library by library with a test suite for each step along the way,
you can write good and robust code. Also, if you are developing
numerical software, please don't expect that other users of your code will be
getting a high while entering data for your <dfn>input files</dfn>. Instead write
an interactive utility that will allow users to configure input files in
a user friendly way. Granted, this is too much work in Fortran. Then again,
you do know more powerful languages, don't you?

   <p>Examples of useful libraries are
things like linear algebra libraries, general ODE solvers, interpolation
algorithms, and so on. 
As a result you end up with two packages. A package
of libraries complete with a test suite, and a package of applications that
invoke the libraries. 
The package of libraries is well-tested code that can be passed down to
future developers. It is code that won't have to be rewritten if it's
treated with respect. The package of applications is something that each
developer will probably rewrite since different people will probably want
to solve different problems. The effect of having a package of libraries
is that C++ is elevated to a <em>Very High Level Language</em> that's closer
to the problems you are solving. 
In fact a good rule of thumb is to
<em>make the libraries sufficiently sophisticated so that each executable that you produce can be expressed in </em><strong>one</strong><em> source file.</em>
All this may sound like common sense, but you will be surprised at how many
scientific developers maintain just one does-everything-program that they
perpetually hack until it becomes impossible to maintain. And then you will
be even more surprised when you find that some professors don't understand
why a &ldquo;simple mathematical modification&rdquo; of someone else's code is taking
you so long.

   <p>Every library must have its own directory and <code>Makefile</code>. So a library
package will have many subdirectories, each directory being one library. 
And perhaps if you have too many of them, you might want to group them
even further down. Then, there's the <dfn>applications</dfn>. If you've done
everything right, there should be enough stuff in your libraries to enable
you to have one source file per application. Which means that all the source
files can probably go down under the same directory.

   <p>Very often you will
come to a situation where there's something that your libraries to-date
can't do, so you implement it and stick it along in your source file
for the application. If you find yourself cut and pasting that implementation
to other source files, then this means that you have to put this in a library
somewhere. And if it doesn't belong to any library you've written so far,
maybe to a new library. When you are in a deadline crunch, there's a
tendency not to do this since it's easier to cut and paste. The problem
is that if you don't take action right then, eventually your code will
degenerate to a hard-to-use mess. Keeping the entropy down is something
that must be done on a daily basis.

   <p>Finally, a word about the age-old issue of language-choice. The GNU coding
standards encourage you to program in C and avoid using languages other
than C, such as C++ or Fortran. The main advantage of C over C++ and
Fortran is that it produces object files that can be linked by any C
or C++ compiler. In contrast, C++ object files can only be linked by
the compiler that produced them. As for Fortran, aside from the fact that
Fortran 90 and 95 have no free compilers, it is not very trivial to mix
Fortran 77 with C/C++, so it makes no sense to invite all that trouble
without a compelling reason. Nevertheless, my suggestion is to code in C++. 
The main benefit you get with C++ is robustness. Having constructors
and destructors and references can go a long way towayrds helping you to
void memory errors, if you know how to make them work for you.
