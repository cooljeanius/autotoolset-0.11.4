<h3 class="section">5.1 Hello World revisited</h3>

<p>To begin, let's review the simplest example, the hello world program:
     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="file">hello.c</span></samp><dd>
     <pre class="example">          #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
          main()
          {
           printf("Howdy, world!\n");
          }
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"><br><dt><samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp><dd>
     <pre class="example">          bin_PROGRAMS = hello
          hello_SOURCES = hello.c
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"><br><dt><samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp><dd>
     <pre class="example">          AC_INIT(hello.cc)
          AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(hello,1.0)
          AC_PROG_CC
          AC_PROG_INSTALL
          AC_OUTPUT(Makefile)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"></dl>

   <p>The language of <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> is a <dfn>logic language</dfn>. There is no
explicit statement of execution. Only a statement of relations from which
execution is inferred. On the other hand, the language of <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp>
is <dfn>procedural</dfn>. Each line of <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp> is a command that
is executed.

   <p>Seen in this light, here's what the <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp> commands shown do:
     <ul>
<li>The <code>AC_INIT</code> command initializes the configure script. It must be
passed as argument the name of one of the source files. Any source file
will do. 
<li>The <code>AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE</code> performs some further initializations that are
related to the fact that we are using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">automake</span></samp>&rsquo;. If you are writing
your <samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp> by hand, then you don't need to call this command. 
The two comma-separated arguments are the name of the package and the
version number. 
<li>The <code>AC_PROG_CC</code> checks to see which C compiler you have. 
<li>The <code>AC_PROG_INSTALL</code> checks to see whether your system has a BSD
compatible install utility. If not then it uses <samp><span class="file">install-sh</span></samp> which
<samp><span class="file">automake</span></samp> will install at the root of your package directory if it's
not there yet. 
<li>The <code>AC_OUTPUT</code> tells the configure script to generate <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>
from <samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp>
</ul>

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> is more obvious. The first line specifies the name
of the program we are building. The second line specifies the source files
that compose the program.

   <p>For now, as far as <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp> is concerned you need to know the
following additional facts:
     <ul>
<li>If you are building a library, then your configure script must determine
how to handle &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ranlib</span></samp>&rsquo;. To do that, add the <code>AC_PROG_RANLIB</code>
command. 
<li>If you want to have your makefiles call recursively makefiles at subdirectories
then the configure script needs to be told to find out how to do that. 
For this purpose you add the <code>AC_PROG_MAKE_SET</code> command. 
<li>If you have any makefiles in subdirectories you must also put them in the
<code>AC_OUTPUT</code> statement like this:
     <pre class="example">          AC_OUTPUT(Makefile          \
                    dir1/Makefile     \
                    dir2/Makefile     \
                   )
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Note that the backslashes are not needed if you are using the bash shell. 
For portability reasons, however, it is a good idea to include them. 
</ul>

   <p>As we explained before to build this package you need to execute the following
commands:
<pre class="example">     % aclocal
     % autoconf
     % touch README AUTHORS NEWS ChangeLog
     % automake -a
     % configure
     % make
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first three commands, are for the maintainer only. When the user unpacks
a distribution, he should be able to start from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">configure</span></samp>&rsquo; and move on.
     <ul>
<li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">aclocal</span></samp>&rsquo; command installs a file called <samp><span class="file">aclocal.m4</span></samp>. Normally,
in that file you are supposed to place the definitions of any &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">autoconf</span></samp>&rsquo;
macros that you've written that happen to be in use in <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp>. 
We will teach you how to write &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">autoconf</span></samp>&rsquo; macros later. 
The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">automake</span></samp>&rsquo; utility uses the <code>AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE</code> macro which is
not part of the standard &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">autoconf</span></samp>&rsquo; macros. For this reason, it's
definition needs to be placed in <samp><span class="file">aclocal.m4</span></samp>. If you call &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">aclocal</span></samp>&rsquo;
with no arguments then it will generate the appropriate <samp><span class="file">aclocal.m4</span></samp> file. 
Later we will show you how to use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">aclocal</span></samp>&rsquo; to also install your
own &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">autoconf</span></samp>&rsquo; macros. 
<li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">autoconf</span></samp>&rsquo; command combines the <samp><span class="file">aclocal.m4</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp> files and produces the <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> script. 
And now we are in bussiness. 
<li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">touch</span></samp>&rsquo; command makes the files <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> and friends exist. 
It is important that these files exist before calling Automake, because
Automake decides whether to include them in a distribution by checking
if they exist at the time that you invoke &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">automake</span></samp>&rsquo;. Automake
<em>must</em> decide to include these files, because when you type
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make distcheck</span></samp>&rsquo; the presense of these files will be required. 
<li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">automake</span></samp>&rsquo; command compiles a <samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp> file from
<samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> and if absent it installs various files that are required
either by the GNU coding standards or by the makefile that will be generated. 
</ul>

   <p>If you are curious you can take a look at the generated <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>. 
It looks like gorilla spit but it will give you an idea of how one gets
there from the <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp>.

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">configure</span></samp>&rsquo; script is an information gatherer. It finds out things
about your system. That information is given to you in two ways. One way
is through defining C preprocessor macros that you can test for directly
in your source code with preprocessor directives. This is done by passing
<code>-D</code> flags to the compiler. The other way is by making certain
variables defined at the <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> level. This way you can, for
example, have the configure script find out how a certain library is linked,
export is as a <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> variable and use that variable in your
<samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp>. Also, through certain special variables, <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp>
can control how the compiler is invoked by the <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>.
