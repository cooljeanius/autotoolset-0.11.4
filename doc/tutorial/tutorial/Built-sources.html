<h3 class="section">5.9 Built sources</h3>

<p>In some complicated packages, you want to generate part of their source
code by executing a program at compile time. For example, in one of
the packages that I wrote for an assignment, I had to generate a file
<samp><span class="file">incidence.out</span></samp> that contained a lot of hairy matrix definitions that
were too ugly to just compute and write by hand. That file was then
included by <samp><span class="file">fem.cc</span></samp> which was part of a library that I wrote to
solve simple finite element problems, with a preprocessor statement:
<pre class="example">     #include "incidence.out"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">All source code files that are to be generated during compile time should
be listed in the global definition of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">BUILT_SOURCES</span></samp>&rsquo;. This will
make sure that these files get compiled before anything else. In our
example, the file <samp><span class="file">incidence.out</span></samp> is computed by running a program
called <samp><span class="file">incidence</span></samp> which of course also needs to be compiled before
it is run. So the <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> that we used looked like this:
<pre class="example">     noinst_PROGRAMS = incidence
     lib_LIBRARIES = libpmf.a
     
     incidence_SOURCES = incidence.cc mathutil.h
     incidence_LDADD = -lm
     
     incidence.out: incidence
           ./incidence &gt; incidence.out
     
     BUILT_SOURCES = incidence.out
     libpmf_a_SOURCES = laplace.cc laplace.h fem.cc fem.h mathutil.h
     
     check_PROGRAMS = test1 test2
     TESTS = $(check_PROGRAMS)
     
     test1_SOURCES = test1.cc
     test1_LDADD = libpmf.a -lm
     
     test2_SOURCES = test2.cc
     test2_LDADD = libpmf.a -lm
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that because the executable <samp><span class="file">incidence</span></samp> has been created at
compile time, the correct path is <samp><span class="file">./incidence</span></samp>. Always keep in mind,
that the correct path to source files, such as <samp><span class="file">incidence.cc</span></samp> is
<samp><span class="file">$(srcdir)/incidence.cc</span></samp>. Because the <samp><span class="file">incidence</span></samp> program is used
temporarily only for the purposes of building the <samp><span class="file">libpmf.a</span></samp> library,
there is no reason to install it. So, we use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">noinst</span></samp>&rsquo; prefix to
instruct Automake not to install it.
