2003-06-09  Marcelo Roberto Jimenez  <mroberto@cetuc.puc-rio.br>

	* doc/tutorial/basic_concepts.texi: written the section
	``Hello world with an attitude''. 

	* src/acmkdir/acmkdir.sh: up to date with current automake

2003-04-03  Marcelo Roberto Jimenez  <mroberto@cetuc.puc-rio.br>

	* doc/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): removed gnu coding standards, because
	it is now distributed with binutils
	
	* removed texi2html, because it conflicts with tetex
	
	* merged with Elef's updates

2003-03-07  Marcelo Roberto Jimenez  <mroberto@cetuc.puc-rio.br>

	* misc/autotoolset.spec.in (Packager): Changed package name to put
	it in SourceForge

2003-02-21  Marcelo Roberto Jimenez  <mroberto@cetuc.puc-rio.br>

	* misc/autotools.spec.in (Packager): updated 'source:' to use .bz2 
	compression

	* misc/finalize: remove tar.gz, we no longer need it. Unfortunately
	that can't be done from within the root Makefile.am.

	* configure.ac: using bz2 compression in distribution

	* doc/tutorial/tutorial.texi: Missing @direntry/@dircategory, the 
	tutorial wasn't liseted in the dir file

	* src/acmkdir/python/configure.ac.zope: updated deprecated macros

	* src/acmkdir/python/Makefile.am: renamed configure.in.zope to 
	configure.ac.zope

	* src/acmkdir/acmkdir.sh (SUBDIRS): updated deprecated macros to current
	autoconf/automake usage (AC_INIT, AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE, AC_CONFIG_FILES, 
	AC_OUTPUT)

	* Makefile.am: rpm targets to create rpms. No longer needs scripts to
	do that. The possible targets are 
	- rpm: build source and binary
	- rpm-bin: build only binary
	- rpm-src: build only source
	- rpm-sig or rpm-sign: build source and binary and sign

	* configure.ac: Created config dir to put autoconf stuff and unclutter
	the root directory.

2003-02-19  Marcelo Roberto Jimenez  <mroberto@cetuc.puc-rio.br>

	* autotools.spec.in (Packager): Created rpm support. Now you can 
	create rpms by doing: rpmbuild -ta autotools-0.11.0.tar.gz.

	* configure.ac: renamed configure.in to configure.ac.

	* src/acmkdir/python/Makefile.am (dist_autotoolspython_DATA): put a
	dist_ prefix to include the files in the distribution

	* reconf: removed -v flag from automake

	* configure.in: updated AC_INIT, AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE, AC_CONFIG_FILES
	and AC_OUTPUT

	* doc/gnu/Makefile.am (mostlyclean-local): I don't know why, but 
	automake isn't generating rm -f standards.cps in mostlyclean-aminfo,
	so I have put a mostlyclean-local here to do the job.

2003-02-18  Marcelo Roberto Jimenez  <mroberto@cetuc.puc-rio.br>

	* src/acmkdir/acmkdir.sh 
	(distclean): removed tag distclean 
	(SUBDIRS): added doc

	* Optimized the Zope development tree, "-t zope" switch!

2001-10-26  Thierry MICHEL  <thierry@nekhem.com>

	* Modified the top directory Makefile.am file. Now disctclean
	operation does its work!

2001-10-10  Thierry MICHEL  <thierry@nekhem.com>

	* Added interfaces directory for ZOPE products.

	* src/acmkdir/acmkdir.sh: Added features and files to handle zope 
	products creation. Some bugs for python/pythondist/zopedist fixed.

2001-07-08  Thierry MICHEL  <thierry@nekhem.com>

	* src/acmkdir/acmkdir.sh: Added dtml and img directories creation
	during zopedist process

	* Added dynamic informations to setup.py file
	* pythondist mode bugs and rules fixed 
	* Automake rules fixed for acmkdir and python/zope options

	* src/emacs/gpl.el: Added support for python in (x)emacs with the
	command:
		M-x gpl-python and M-x gpl-pythonL

	* src/mkconfig/: New program.

1998-10-21  Eleftherios Gkioulekas  <lf@amath.washington.edu>

	* m4/lf_cxx.m4: Fixed the definition of the 'for' workaround 
	to #define for if(0) ; else for
	Previous definition can't do "dangling else" correctly
	(Reported by Nathan Myers)
	
1998-09-01  Eleftherios Gkioulekas  <lf@amath.washington.edu>

	It is likely that more are coming in future versions

	* src/texitools: Renamed to texi2html since only that programs
	is and will be distributed under that directory

	* src/old: Removed a directory with obsolete programs. Also
	removed support for that monster texidoc.

1998-08-20  Eleftherios Gkioulekas  <lf@amath.washington.edu>

	* src/acconfig/acconfig.pl: Read in also configure.in looking for
	acconfig directives.

1998-08-03  Eleftherios Gkioulekas  <lf@amath.washington.edu>

	* m4/lf_cxx.m4: Bug fix at ACCONFIG BOTTOM. The 'pi' definition must
	be surrounded with conditional inclusion so that if the config.h
	file is included twice I don't get errors about redefinitions. 
	Removed the assert support in acconfig. The macro now will handle
	assert by defining NDEBUG.

1998-07-29  Eleftherios Gkioulekas  <lf@amath.washington.edu>

	* m4/lf_bash.m4: New file.

	* src/txtc/txtc.sh: Fixed bug triggered by non-GNU sed.

	Corresponding changes in Makefile.am

1998-07-15    <lf@amath.washington.edu>

	* src/texitools/texidoc.pl: Added call to @shorttitlepage which
	is way cool!

	* src/acmkdir/acmkdir.sh (create_doc_directory): Install texirm.sh
	in the texidoc directory as well.

	* m4/lf_texidoc.m4: New file

	* src/acmkdir/doc_makefile.am: Made changes such that documentation

1998-07-13    <lf@amath.washington.edu>

	* src/acmkdir/acmkdir.sh (make_m4_makefile): Removed support for mkm4.
	It's not really a good idea.

	* src/Makefile.am: Successfully reorganized the source directory
	tree to subdirectories.

1998-07-07    <lf@amath.washington.edu>

	* Version 0.7: Cutting
	
	* src/Makefile.am: Handle f2c_comp.sh

	* src/f2c_comp.sh: New file. 

	* m4/lf_newfortran.m4: This file will now replace lf_fortran.m4

	* m4/Makefile.am: Added new file lf_nm.m4 from libtool.m4

1998-07-06    <lf@amath.washington.edu>

	* m4/lf_newfortran.m4: New file. To replace eventually lf_fortran.m4

	* src/acmkdir.sh (make_toplevel_makefile_default): Take into account 
	the new implementation of the LF_CONFIGURE_[CC|CXX] macros.

1998-07-04    <lf@amath.washington.edu>

	* m4/lf_cpp.m4 (LF_CONFIGURE_CC): Removed the AC_PROVIDE statement.
	I don't quite understand why this is so right now, but it seems to
	be a bug. 

1998-07-01  Eleftherios Gkioulekas  <lf@amath.washington.edu>

	* m4/lf_local.m4 (LF_SET_INCLUDES): Significant change.
	Now the @default_includes@ symbol is not substituted into the
	full INCLUDES assignment. Now the user must say
	INCLUDES = $(default_includes)
	instead.

1998-06-30  Eleftherios Gkioulekas  <lf@amath.washington.edu>

	* m4/lf_local.m4 (LF_SET_INCLUDES): Forgot to quote the assignments
	like lf_dirs="`echo $1`". Fixed it. 

1998-06-29  Eleftherios Gkioulekas  <lf@amath.washington.edu>

	* m4/lf_cpp_port.m4 (ACCONFIG_BOTTOM): Replaced segmentation fault
	with abort(); 

	* m4/lf_cpp.m4 (LF_CONFIGURE_CC): 
	Added call to AC_PROVIDE for AC_PROG_CC, since this call is

1998-06-26  Eleftherios Gkioulekas  <lf@amath.washington.edu>

	* src/acmkdir.sh (create_toplevel_directory): 
	Fixed spelling error. Also, current working directory is now
	printed on its own line.

1998-06-19  Eleftherios Gkioulekas  <lf@amath.washington.edu>

	* Version 0.6.1: Cutting
	* doc/tutorial/1_basic_concepts.doc: Fixed an error in the hello
	world example. Autoconf must be called before Automake. 
	Reported by Karl Dalley. 

1998-06-18  Eleftherios Gkioulekas  <lf@amath.washington.edu>

	* src/doc_makefile.am (TEXIDOC): Bug fix. Forgot to assign TEXI2DVI.

	longer be distributed. Use Emacs instead.

1998-05-17  Eleftherios Gkioulekas  <lf@amath.washington.edu>

	* src/acmkdir.sh: Now acmkdir will put better default content
	  to the files README, NEWS, AUTHORS, THANKS

Fri Apr 17 10:35:41 PDT 1998
Eleftherios Gkioulekas <lf@amath.washington.edu>
 
   *  f2c_target.am, lf_fortran.m4:
      Instead of setting F2C, we plug in a relative
      pathname at f2c_target.am.
      This looks a little better at make-time.
 
 
Mon Apr 13 15:39:51 PDT 1998
Eleftherios Gkioulekas <lf@amath.washington.edu>
 
   *  Cutting version 0.5.0
 
   *  mkm4 is a completely different application from what it used to be.
 
   *  The gpl utility has some new options
 
   *  mkpkgdir has been renamed to acmkdir
      acconfig is a new utility
 
   *  Numerous changes that I've been too lazy to catalog.
      Basically now the macros use $(datadir)/aclocal instead of
      being distributed with the directory tree of each application.
 
 
Tue Mar 24 18:18:31 PST 1998
Eleftherios Gkioulekas <lf@amath.washington.edu>
 
   *  Cutting version 0.4.0
 
 
Thu Mar 12 18:44:47 PST 1998
Eleftherios Gkioulekas <lf@amath.washington.edu>
 
   *  local.m4, local_include.am, local_lib.am:
      Lots of bug fixes and testing.
 
 
Wed Mar 11 20:00:47 PST 1998
Eleftherios Gkioulekas <lf@amath.washington.edu>
 
   *  local.m4: New file
      local_include.am: New file
      local_lib.am: New file
      These files implement the local-install-as-you-build scheme
      It's pretty cool.
 
 
Tue Mar 10 20:34:37 PST 1998
Eleftherios Gkioulekas <lf@amath.washington.edu>
 
   *  mkpkgdir.bash:
      Now the 'reconf' script does
      rm -f config.cache
      to clean the cache.
 
   *  cpp.m4:
      Deleted LF_CHECK_MATH_LIBRARY and LF_CXX_LIFETIME_OF_TEMPORARIES
      and another silly macro.
      Also deleted references to LF_CHECK_MATH_LIBRARY from other macros
     
 
 
Tue Mar 10 18:05:08 PST 1998
Eleftherios Gkioulekas <lf@amath.washington.edu>
 
   *  Cutting version 0.3.0
 
 
Tue Mar 10 18:00:47 PST 1998
Eleftherios Gkioulekas <lf@amath.washington.edu>
 
   *  Now the distribution passes the `make distcheck` test.
 
   *  mkpkgdir.bash
      Modified the 'reconf' script to account for *bot and *top files
      and deal with config.h
      Also modified the generated Makefile.am
 
   *  cpp.h.bot: New file.
      This file will replace cpp.h
 
   *  cpp.m4: [LF_USE_CPP_H]
      Has been renamed to LF_CPP_PORTABILITY. Now it does not generate a cpp.h
      It only gets the macros defined.
 
 
Mon Mar 9 23:34:26 PST 1998
Eleftherios Gkioulekas <lf@amath.washington.edu>
 
   *  Cut release 0.2.0
 
 
Mon Mar 9 20:00:44 PST 1998
Eleftherios Gkioulekas <lf@amath.washington.edu>
 
   *  f2c_target.am: New file
      f77_target.am: New file
 
   *  fortran.m4: [LF_CONFIGURE_FORTRAN]
      Now it defines @fortran_target@ to include the appropriate targets
      in the Makefile.am. You no longer have to explicitly deal with
      the Fortran targets yourself.
 
   *  mkpkgdir.bash:
      Now takes into account *.h and Makefile.am files.
 
   *  txtc.am: new file
 
   *  txtc.m4:
      Bug fixes. Make it work with distcheck.
      Also use AC_SUBST_FILE to deal with the Makefile.am target.
 
   *  cpp.m4 [LF_USE_CPP_H]:
      Fixed bug. Macro USE_MATHUTIL_ASSERT has been changed to USE_ASSERT.
      Doh.
 
   *  f2c.h:
      Now INTEGER is int, not 'long int'. I guess they used 'long int'
      for the sake of Windoze where 'int' is 16bit. Yuck.
 
 
Fri Mar 6 20:35:14 PST 1998
Eleftherios Gkioulekas <lf@amath.washington.edu>
 
   *  Cut version 0.1.0
 
   *  Using new versioning system, described in README.versions
 
 
Fri Mar 6 19:57:48 PST 1998
Eleftherios Gkioulekas <lf@amath.washington.edu>
 
   *  Now the tutorial explains how autoconf configure files
      work. That's quite an improvement. There is also a hello-world
      revisited chapter illustrating the gnustd tools. As a consequence
      I removed that silly chapter on mkpkgdir.
 
   *  mkpkgdir.bash:
      Now including LF_HOST_TYPE in all configure.in files, regardless of whether
      or not you are using Fortran is the default.
 
   *  mkpkgdir.bash:
      Fixed a bug with -f mode. Now sets the correct package name
      in call to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE in the automatically generated
      configure.in file.
 
   *  mkpkgdir.bash:
      Take into account the previous modifications in cpp.m4
 
   *  cpp.m4: [LF_CONFIGURE_CXX]
      Removed the call to AC_RANLIB. You must now explicitly make that call.
 
   *  cpp.m4: Portability tests in LF_CONFIGURE_CXX have been moved to
      LF_INSTALL_CPP_H which has been renamed to LF_USE_CPP_H
 
   *  fortran.m4: [LF_CONFIGURE_FORTRAN]
      Now pass to f2c the following flags: -f -g -A
 
 
Thu Mar 5 12:58:16 PST 1998
Eleftherios Gkioulekas <lf@amath.washington.edu>
 
   *  cpp.m4: [LF_CONFIGURE_FORTRAN]
      Removed some silly stuff about -mieee-fp and -mieee and -fpe1
      I am not so sure I want these to be the defaults.
 
   *  cpp.m4: [LF_CONFIGURE_CC]
      Forgot to AC_SUBST CC and CFLAGS. Ooops.
 
   *  mkf2c.sh: The targets provided for f2c don't use ${CFLAGS} when calling
      the C compiler. Bad. Now they do.
 
   *  fortran.m4: [LF_CONFIGURE_FORTRAN]
      Don't set optimization here. It will be set by the
      LF_SET_OPTIMIZATION macro
 
   *  mkpkgdir.bash: Make it aware of the new macros:
      LF_SET_OPTIMIZATION and LF_SET_WARNINGS
 
   *  cpp.m4: New macros: LF_CHECK_F77_FLAG, LF_SET_OPTIMIZATION,
                          LF_SET_WARNINGS
 
   *  cpp.m4: New macro: LF_CHECK_CC_FLAG
 
 
Thu Feb 26 17:53:30 PST 1998
Eleftherios Gkioulekas <lf@amath.washington.edu>
 
   *  mkfortran: New script to create a copy of the f2c compiler in the
      directory tree
      mkf2c: New script to create header files that are good to have around
      when integrating Fortran code with C/C++ code, such as f2c.h
 
   *  Renamed: LF_CHECK_COMPILER_FLAGS -> LF_CHECK_CXX_FLAGS
 
   *  New file: fortran.m4
      Implements macros for configuring Fortran compilers
 
   *  Cutting distribution 1.3
 
 
Tue Feb 24 15:34:23 PST 1998
Eleftherios Gkioulekas <lf@amath.washington.edu>
 
   *  cpp.m4:
      Added support for --with-warnings as is claimed in the tutorial.
      Also prints a message when checking for optimization.
 
   *  texirm:
      Now it also deletes the files with suffixes: cps, cv, op, tr
      Argh, how many more of these damn suffixes are out there?
 
   *  Improvements in the tutorial.
      Also now there is a set of subdirectories in doc/ for
      every document.
 
   *  mkpkgdir.bash:
      Now the toplevel Makefile.am that gets created will
      include "configure" in the EXTRA_DIST.
      Probably not necessary, but paranoia is good.
 
 
Fri Feb 20 14:50:40 PST 1998
Eleftherios Gkioulekas <lf@amath.washington.edu>
 
   *  More improvements on the Autoconf tutorial
 
 
Thu Feb 19 04:56:29 PST 1998
Eleftherios Gkioulekas <lf@amath.washington.edu>
 
   *  cpp.m4:
      Took out AC_PROG_INSTALL and AC_PROG_MAKE_SET from LF_CONFIGURE_CXX
      They are not needed since they are called by AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
 
   *  Minor other improvements all over the tutorial.
 
   *  Improved my blurb on copyrights even more. Now it makes better
      sense. Phew!
 
 
Thu Feb 12 18:24:19 PST 1998
Eleftherios Gkioulekas <lf@amath.washington.edu>
 
   *  Cutting version 1.2
 
   *  Reorganized the tutorial again. The copyright propaganda and the info
      file maintance stuff was moved to Chapter 1. Chapter 2 now is
      about Makefiles, and Chapter 3 goes ahead with Automake.
      This, I believe, makes the tutorial more coherent.
 
 
Thu Feb 12 04:56:53 PST 1998
Eleftherios Gkioulekas <lf@amath.washington.edu>
 
   *  Did some major restructuring of Chapter 1 and took out all the
      propaganda stuff which really belongs to Chapter 3. The next
      step is to restructure Chapter 3 :-)
 
 
Sun Feb 8 09:51:17 PST 1998
Eleftherios Gkioulekas <lf@amath.washington.edu>
 
   *  Fixed cpp.h as generated by cpp.m4. Added the standard
      #ifndef #define #endif sequence to make sure that cpp.h is
      included only once for every postprocessed source file.
 
 
Sat Feb 7 13:14:22 PST 1998
Eleftherios Gkioulekas <lf@amath.washington.edu>
 
   *  Cutting version 1.1
 
   *  Fixed bugs at tutorial.doc
 
   *  Now changelog supports the -view option
 
 
Fri Feb 6 22:46:11 PST 1998
Eleftherios Gkioulekas <lf@amath.washington.edu>
 
   *  The texidoc utility now also generates the appropriate
      @ifinfo ... @end ifinfo code with the copyright notice allowing
      it to also appear in the text file.
 
   *  Now the texidoc utility can generate appropriate copyright notice
