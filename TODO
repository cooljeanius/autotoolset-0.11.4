- Change:

- Update:
    * The Autotoolset info pages still use deprecated autoconf/automake
      syntax.

- Fix:
    * The following warning is beeing reported while byte compiling gpl.el:
While compiling toplevel forms in file /home/mroberto/programs/autotools/autotools.new/autotools-0.2.0/=build/src/emacs/elc.25629/gpl.el:
  ** assignment to free variable user-company-name

- Doubts:
    * What is/was the file src/acmkdir/python/new_install_python.txt? It
      has zero size.

    * Maybe we could use the primary PYTHON in
      src/acmkdir/python/Makefile.am (not sure if already done by now?)?
