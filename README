The Autotoolset package complements the GNU build system by providing the
following features:

* Automatic generation of legal notices that are needed in order to
  apply the GNU GPL license.

* Automatic generation of directory trees for new software packages, such
  that they conform to the GNITS standard (more or less).

* Some rudimentary portability framework for C++ programs. There is a lot
  of room for improvement here, in the future. Also a framework for
  embedding text into your executable and handling include files accross
  multiple directories.

* Support for writing portable software that uses both Fortran and C++.

* Additional support for writing software documentation in Texinfo, but
  also in LaTeX.

* A manual introducing both the Autotoolset and the GNU build system in a 
  unified task-oriented manner.

The Autotoolset is free software. Please see the file COPYING for details.
For documentation, please see the files in the doc subdirectory.
For building and installation instructions please see the INSTALL file.

(Note: I have changed all references to this project's name to consistently
be "autotoolset" instead of just "autotools", because just "autotools"
without the "set" at the end is used colloquially to refer to the GNU build
system in general)
